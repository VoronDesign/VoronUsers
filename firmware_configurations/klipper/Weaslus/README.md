This file contains a ready to go setup for the Voron 0 modified and tidied by Weaslus. This should provide you with all the functionality you require 
for an enclosed headless printer with a # heatsoak macro that will start automatically if your print bed target temperature is above 100c

Nothing grand otherwise, but small quality of life edits. It should serve to make the Macro's and options for Print_start_1 and slicer stat gcode
easier to see and share.
