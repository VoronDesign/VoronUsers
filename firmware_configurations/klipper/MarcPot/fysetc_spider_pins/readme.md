# Fysetc Spider Pin Aliases

This file has been created by MarcPot of the 3D(IY) Printing NL/BE Community Discord server.
It is based on the SPIDER info page on the Fysetc website at https://wiki.fysetc.com/Spider/

This file is made to be able to use more clear names in your klipper config for the different pins on the Fysetc SPIDER mcu.
You can either add it to your printer.cfg or include it by using the klipper [include $PATH_TO_FILE] functionality.
