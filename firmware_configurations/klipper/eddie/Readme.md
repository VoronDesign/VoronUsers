Hello everyone! This guide has been depreciated, the new documentation is present here:

Please use this reference moving forward.



For configuration files, please check the respective repos (Voron-1, Voron-2, etc) for the most up to date configurations.

I am leaving the PDF here for your reference in case you wish to refer back to it in the future, though the information in it may be outdated. 



Thanks!
