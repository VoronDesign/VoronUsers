## IMPORTANT ##
Please make sure that you have Rev.B board since BTT released a bad board initially and there is a revision on the initial SKR v2 board.

BTT apparently offers full refund for the bad boards, or you can also fix it yourself.

This guy Chris knows his stuff and explain this in details in this video.
