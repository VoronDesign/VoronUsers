## Design goals ##
* Provide working configuration for Big Tree Tech SKR v2 mainboard
* Use SKR v2 connections as they were intented when possible
* Use same connections as SKR v1.4 when possible

## IMPORTANT ##
Please make sure that you have Rev.B board since BTT released a bad board initially and there is a revision on the initial SKR v2 board.

BTT apparently offers full refund for the bad boards, or you can also fix it yourself.

This guy Chris knows his stuff and explain this in details in this video.
