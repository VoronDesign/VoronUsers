## Design goals ##
* Provide working configuration for Big Tree Tech SKR v2 mainboard
* Use SKR v2 connections as they were intented when possible
* Use same connections as SKR v1.4 when possible

## IMPORTANT NOTES ##

* The SKR v2 Board does not require cutting any pins on the drivers for sensorless homing.

* It is recommended to always remove power to the SKR Boards before adding/removing a stepper driver daughterboard.

* Please make sure that you have Rev.B board since BTT released a bad board initially and there is a revision on the initial SKR v2 board.

  BTT apparently offers full refund for the bad boards, or you can also fix it yourself.
