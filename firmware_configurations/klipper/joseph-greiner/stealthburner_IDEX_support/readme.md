This file updates the stealthburner_leds.cfg to have compatibility with IDEX printers running klipper.
It is also 100% compatible with standard single toolhead printers.

Single toolhead users: set the LED data pin as you would normally, done.

IDEX users, uncomment the T1 section and set the LED data pins.

All macros will be run on the active toolhead.
