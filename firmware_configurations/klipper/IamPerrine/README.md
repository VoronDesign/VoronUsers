# Voron Config

Here are my Voron 2.2 config files. 

Both configs are based on skr 1.3s with 2209s and the Rappel Extruder

Running the Annex Engineering Direct A/B Mods, Metal Z Mod, and Dual X rail Mod.

Included is a custom ADC Table for the Slice Thermistor.

Fade Config has Safe_Z_Home and has newer filament swap macros. Confirmed works with Prusa Slicer Color Swaps.

Pancake has my default filament runout macros. Doesn't work with Prusa Slicer Color Swaps.
