# Firmware Configurations

Firmware Configurations for Voron 3D printers, separated by firmware.
Remember to update this README when uploading new firmware configurations!

## Legacy printers

Configurations for legacy printers can be found [here](../legacy_printers/firmware_configurations). 
If one of your configurations applies to a current generation Voron printer, contact the admins in 
Discord to have your mod moved to this folder.

## Table structure

Update the following table with the information about your mod:
- Your name
- A link to your sub-folder
- A short description of your firmware config
- The printer compatibility. Use `:heavy_check_mark:` for :heavy_check_mark:,`:x:` for :x: and `:grey_question:` for :grey_question:

`
