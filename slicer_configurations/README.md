# Slicer Configurations

Slicer Configurations for Voron 3D printers, separated by slicer.
Remember to update this README when uploading new slicer configurations!

## Legacy printers

Configurations for legacy printers can be found [here](../legacy_printers/slicer_configurations). 
If one of your configurations applies to a current generation Voron printer, contact the admins in 
Discord to have your mod moved to this folder.

## Table structure

Update the following table with the information about your mod:
- Your name
- A link to your sub-folder
- A short description of your slicer config
- The printer compatibility. Use `:heavy_check_mark:` for :heavy_check_mark:,`:x:` for :x: and `:grey_question:` for :grey_question:

like so:
`
| Creator | [Config Title](link) | Description | :x: | :x: | :x: |`

| Creator | Config title | Description | V0 | V1.8 | V2.4 |
