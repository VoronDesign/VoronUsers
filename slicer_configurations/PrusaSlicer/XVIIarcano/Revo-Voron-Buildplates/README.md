# Revo-Voron-Buildplate-images
A set of images to remind you what nozzle is associated to your print profile.

With the posisbility of easily change the nozzle for each print, comes the very real possibility to forget about updating the printer profile in the slicer.

NO MORE (well, let's say a bit less at least...)! 
If you associate to each profile one of these conveniently colored reminders, you MAY avoid some blunder.

Any image will work for any bed size, but if you select the right set (350mm coming soon), the grid will be in 10mm-ish squares (not reliable, but good for eyeballing).
