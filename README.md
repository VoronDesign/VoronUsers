# VoronUsers repository

Welcome to the VoronUsers github repository. This is a place to share your awesome mods for the VoronDesign 3D printers and find useful resources from other Voron community members.

Check the [`printer_mods`](./printer_mods) folder for mods that apply to the current generation of printers. 

All mods that apply to older (=legacy printers) can be found in the [legacy printers](./legacy_printers) folder.

Orphaned mods where the authors have abandoned development can be found in the [orphaned mods](./orphaned_mods/) folder. If you want to start maintaining one of these mods, feel free to reach out via a github issue.
