# VoronUsers repository

Welcome to the VoronUsers github repository. This is a place to share your awesome mods for the Voron0, Voron1 and Voron2 3D printers and find useful resources from other Voron community members.

Check the [`printer_mods`](./printer_mods) [`firmware_configurations`](./firmware_configurations) and [`slicer_configurations`](./slicer_configurations) folders for mods that apply to 
the current generation of printers. All mods that apply to older (=legacy printers) can be found in the [legacy printers](./legacy_printers) folder.
