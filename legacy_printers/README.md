## Updating a mod

If you maintain a mod and it applies to a current generation printer, contact the admins on discord or file an
issue in this repository to get it updated. You may also submit a PR that updates and moves your mod, but keep in mind
to properly remove it from the legacy folder and its associated README while doing so.
