### Overview

These are parts to mount the [Logitech C270](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Widescreen-designed-Calling-Recording/dp/B004FHO5Y6) or C310 webcam to the front left side of the gantry or to the top center of the frame. There is a small USB wire recess on the gantry mount to wrap the cable around and run down the length of the gantry to the rest of the default cable management solutions. A USB extension will be required to run the cable properly. The camera is angled so it will clear side panels if enclosed as well. For larger builds, you may not be able to view the entire bed plate. You can use this [fisheye lens](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0179JX8GC/) and this [adapter](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2561414) to increase the field of view.

To run the cable down the extrusion, you can either use this [cable cover](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1478147) or print the included 2020 cover. Printing the included model on its back makes it relatively weak but also a little easier to remove. It will break if you insert/remove more than 2-3 times. This model also lies flush with the Misumi extrusion profile unlike the Thingiverse model.
