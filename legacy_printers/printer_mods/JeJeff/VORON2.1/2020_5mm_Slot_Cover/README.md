# 2020 5mm slot cover

This slot cover is used to clip into the extrusion slot and keep wires within the slot safely contained.  They take a little force to push into the slot, so shouldn't come out accidentally.  I used five of the 10mm long clips across the back extrusion to route the B motor wires along the bottom of the extrusion to the tape chain next to the A motor.

It is designed to 2020 'I' type extrusions with 5mm slot width, (such as that sold by [https://www.dold-mechatronik.de/index.php?k=439&lang=eng](Dold Mechatronik)) so no use for Misumi customers without further modification.
