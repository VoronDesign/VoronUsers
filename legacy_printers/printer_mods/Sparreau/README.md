<b>5v_psupply_mount</b><br>
This fits the 5V power supply from AliExpress.  https://www.aliexpress.com/item/DC-6V-40V-To-5V-3A-Double-USB-Charge-DC-DC-Step-down-Converter-Module/32664778995.html

<b>FSR_circuit_mount</b><br>
This fits the sensor module used in the FSR circuit.  Mine are from Amazon, but it appears to be the same board used in the AliExpress sensor modules.  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B94Q1C8/

<b>\_z_rail_stop_(top/bottom)_x4</b><br>
I made these primarily to set the 25mm spacing of the Z linear bearing rails from the bottom extrusion of the printer.  While I was at it, I re-shaped it to mate up to the rail a bit better.

<b>bed_extrusion_spacer_parametric</b><br>
These are an aid to set the spacing of the bed rails.  To go between 150mm center spaced rails you need 130mm spacers.  You'll have to calculate the outer spacers for your frame size.

<b>dial_indicator_fan_mount</b><br>
This fits a dial indicator from Harbor Freight with a 9.5mm shank along with a 10mm thick extruder fan.  A clothes pin works great for holding the indicator pin up when not in use.  MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT CRASH IT!

<b>mains_plug_panel-parametric</b><br>
This is an alternative mains plug panel for which you can set the size.  I made this because my frame is not a standard size.  The mains panel fills the gap so I can use standard (250/300/350) side skirts.  I slightly enlarged the opening for the IEC320 switch socket, as mine did not fit the original.  I also added recessed slots for the retention clips on the IEC320 switch socket.

<b>z_idler_frame_(a/b)_EXTRA-TAB_x2</b><br>
I had trouble keeping my z idler frames from sagging while trying to tension the belts.  This part includes an extra tab to secure the frame prior to tightening the idler screws.
