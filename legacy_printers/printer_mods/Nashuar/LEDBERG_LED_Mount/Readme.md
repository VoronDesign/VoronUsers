# IKEA Ledberg Mount

This is a holder for the 4x 24V IKEA Ledberg Spots. 

- Print-Settings:
Default Voron2 parts print settings,
no supports needed

- How to install:
Put the LED insert into the mount, rotate it until you can connect the plug and then 
install the complete assembly to the left and right top extrusions. 

I recommend to run the wires through the extrusions and cover it with some extrusion cover inserts.
