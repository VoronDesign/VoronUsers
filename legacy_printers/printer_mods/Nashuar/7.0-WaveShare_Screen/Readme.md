~Dario made a mod of this case to fit waveshare 7" type/model C rev2.2 and alowed me to share it. I don't have this screen to test the prints, so I cannot ensure that the STLs fit. 
I renamed his files with the postfix \_c and renamed my parts for the model H screen with _h.

The case for model H has four printed parts (Back, Mid, Front and Button), the case for model C has two printed parts (Back and Front). The modded swing arms should fit both models.
