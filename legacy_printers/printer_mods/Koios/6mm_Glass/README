This is a modification of the front panel locks to support holding 6mm tempered glass panels.  I used 3m VHB to adhere them to my glass panels so that thickness was considered as well.  The tab which supports the glass was thickened and has proven to be very robust on my printer.

Print the stock lock lever's to go along with these parts.
