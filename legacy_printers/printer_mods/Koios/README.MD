# _LED_Mount_A & _LED_Mount_B

This is a simple LED light bar mount for this 12V LED Strip light: https://www.banggood.com/30CM-8W-SMD5630-Waterproof-U-Shape-Dual-Row-42LEDs-Rigid-Strip-Hard-Bar-Light-DC12V-p-1255036.html

You will need 1 A & 1 B mount for each strip you intend to install, and I positioned them just under my top glass (or plexi).  Beware, running these at 100% duty cycle will get very hot (~80C), and if you have plastic panels it may warp, so you will want to run them with PWM, which is fine since they are very very bright.

I used m3x12 socket head screws to fasten them.


# C920_Top_Front_Mount

This is a mount for a Logitech C920 webcam for the front top extrusion on the Voron 2.  On my 350 the field of view looks like this: ![C920 Field of View](https://i.imgur.com/KBxKvGP.png)

I used to M3x10 SHCS to attach to my extrusion with a couple t-nuts. 

This is a video of the [Disassembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94lDYZgihT4) which you will need to perform in order to use this bracket.  Disassemble until you can get the two metal swivel joints undone, slide into the two holes on the mount, then reassemble.
