# Duet/Duex Fan Mount

### Overview

If you want fans to cool the steppers on your Duet or Duex2/5 then you'll want
these optional mounts.  They're a bit stronger then the default Voron mounts
and allow easy repositioning of the brackets without having to use additional
standoffs.

Please note that these files require your slicer settings to be able to
perform basic bridging.  No supports are required.  You must print at 0.2mm
layer hight so that the single layer bridge for the duet screw mounts is printed
correctly.

### Requirements

Printed Parts:

 * 1x each of the included brackets printed at 0.2mm layer height

Hardware: 

 * 2x 40x40mm fans.  Either 10mm or 20mm fans will do
 * 8x M3 bolts which are 5mm longer then your fans are deep
 * 4x M5x8mm bolts
