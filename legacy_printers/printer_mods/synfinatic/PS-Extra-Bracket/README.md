# Power Supply Extra Bracket

### Overview

By default, the Voron2 uses 
[two brackets](PS-Extra-Bracket.stl)
to mount the 200W 24V power supply to the extrusions.  This works very well
if you mount it to both extrusions holding your bed, but if your extrusions are
mounted too far apart, then you'll need an extra bracket so that power supply
doesn't sag & pivot.

### Requirements

 * 1x PS bracket
 * 1x M5x8mm button head
 * 1x M4x6mm button head
