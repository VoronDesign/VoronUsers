# Probeholder M12

I was not that happy with the stock probe. For mounting a probe with more precision i designed the mount. 
It is inline with the stock mount and can be set in upper and lower position for the Vulcano as you did with the
origial mount. Distances are same between the threads.

You also get the benefit to mount capacitive probes, to parralelize with a BuildTak or other non metal buildsurface.
All M12x1 probes fit up to a length of 60mm.
