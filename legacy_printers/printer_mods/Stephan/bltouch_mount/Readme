For being able to level the gantry with non metal plates on your aluminiumbed you need an alternative to the inductive probe.
The inductive (even the Fotek) had not enough range to go through my 3mm Ikea LOTS mirror. The nozzle allways punished the pei on that mirror.

You need to remove the original mount of the bl to make it fit the 2.1 carriage, see the pictures. For me it had an offset of 1.8mm.

Here my configuration example:

#####################################################

[probe]
pin: z:ar18
x_offset: 0.0
y_offset: 15.0
z_offset: 1.825
speed: 5
activate_gcode:
    SET_SERVO SERVO=bltouch ANGLE=10
    SET_SERVO SERVO=bltouch ANGLE=60
    G4 P200
deactivate_gcode:
    SET_SERVO SERVO=bltouch ANGLE=90
    G4 P200

[servo bltouch]
pin: z:ar11
maximum_servo_angle: 180
minimum_pulse_width: 0.0006
maximum_pulse_width: 0.0024

#######################################################

Theese is the repeatability on TMC2208 with klipper running at 16 microsteps with interpolation and 5mm probespeed in a 300^3 build.
I tried to produce a temperatur drift with enclosure to 60° and at 20° the mesures were the same in both cases.
