# Triangle Labs 2-to-1 Mosquito Toolhead Adapter

### Overview

This adapter allows the Triangle Labs 2-to-1 adapter to mouted ridgedly to the mosquito tool head.  The adapter take the place of the 
official [a]_bsp_adapter_x1_rev1.stl, and uses the threaded mount that came with the adapter.  I filed two flats on the threaded mount
assist with screwing it in (See pictures).  Also included are new connector covers as the old ones don't fit.  You will not be able
to tilt the connector cover up anymore, so the pivot pins have been reduced in size to make removal easier.
