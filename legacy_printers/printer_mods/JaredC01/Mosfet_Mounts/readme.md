This is a mosfet mount panel for 4 or 6 mosfets.  The mosfets this was designed for are located here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F7SV84V  Any of the similar mosfets should also work.  The design is set to use self-tapping plastic screws, which you should have leftover from the build.

## Instructions
1. In your slicer of choice, insert the 4 or 6 mosfet mount STL, and print with the standard Voron print settings.  Ensure the orientation is the same as the picture above, and keep supports turned OFF.
