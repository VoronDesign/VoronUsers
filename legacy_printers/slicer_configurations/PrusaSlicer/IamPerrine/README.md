My baseline Prusa Slicer for a modded V2.2 350x350x150z with a .4 nozzle and no z hop. I recommend the sweet cad model of the bed from bryansj for the best interface. 
My Voron has the Annex Engineering Direct A/B, Metal HDZ, and Dual X Rails.
I've got PLA pretty dialed. ABS requires messing with flow rates (.91-.94).
