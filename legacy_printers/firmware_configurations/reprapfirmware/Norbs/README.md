Sample configuration for the duet2 and duex boards for the latest RRF3.

Please use this for reference only when converting from Duet2 RRF2 to RRF3 firmware. (based on the Voron 2.1 firmware with all the macros and then further butchered by me.)

Minor things to note, config has minor differences than stock voron:

-Obviously a duet2+duex board -300^3

-0.9deg steppers on A/B drive and extruder

-PT100 sensor
