# Sample macro config to be used in conjunction with the Decontaminator Purge Bucket & Nozzle Scrubber mod. Created by Hernsl 
# (hernsl#8860 on Discord) and edited by Edwardyeeks (edwardyeeks#6042 on Discord). Several ideas that made it as features by
# Deutherius (deutherius#3295 on Discord).

# The goal of this macro is to provide a nozzle scrubbing and purging routine that is easily copied/referenced into your  printer.cfg.
# Users can simply change parameters and enable/disable options in the first half. Descriptions are plentiful, making this macro
# look huge but informative and are laid out in sequence to be read first describing the line below; PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.

# This sample config assumes the following: The user has implemented the default decontaminator purge bucket & nozzle scrubber mod
# for the VORON 1/2. It can be tweaked to customised purge bucket geometries and brushes.

# Features in this macro: option of putting the bucket at the rear or front of the bed. Purge routine that can be enabled/disabled.
# By default, bucket is located at rear left of bed and purge routine is enabled. The purge and scrubbing routine is randomized
# in either left or right bucket to ensure as even as possible distribution of filament gunk.

# Default parameters are set for safe speeds and movements. Where necessary, tweak the parameters for the nozzle scrub procedure 
# to fit your printer.

# To avoid adding length of lines to your main printer.cfg config file, one can upload a config file separately into klipper and
# include it into the main printer config. Upload nozzle_scrub.cfg to the same directory as printer.cfg. Usually, it is in /home/pi/.
# Users of Fluidd, Mainsail and other klipper front ends would find it under /home/pi/klipper_config/.

# Once uploaded, add the following to your printer.cfg in the Macros section: [include /home/pi/nozzle_scrub.cfg] 
# Those running Fluidd, Mainsail and other front ends will need to use the following location instead:
# [include /home/pi/klipper_config/nozzle_scrub.cfg]

# If you are putting your purge bucket at the rear left of the bed as per default installation, enable True on your location_bucket_rear
