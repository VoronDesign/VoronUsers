Raspi fanduct for an 4010 fan.
I used fans that fit m3 nuts, so an M3x40 reaches all the way trough.

Mount it with VHB or any other double sided tape to blow (in my case), between the Pi 4 and Waveshare 3 channel relay hat.
My pi also has heatsinks on, small ones, and now stays around 50 degrees while printing (also because of chamber temp and 30 degrees idle.

Printable without support because the SHCS screw holes are chamfered.
