<h1>V2.4 Front and Side skirt with switch mod</h1>

<h3>**Follow the manual for instructions on installation and wiring.** </h3><br/><br/>

NOTE: I am by no means a CAD professional. I have only tested the 300mm mods. Feel free to contact me on the Voron discord (tayto-chip) if you would like the step files. <br/><br/>

All screw and heat-set insert holes are unchanged. <br/><br/>

Switch used is from the V2.4 sourcing guide: [ZF Rocker Switch](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/zf-electronics/WRG32F2FBBNN/446050?s=N4IgTCBcDaIO4CcDmBmMAzDAjLA7XIAugL5A)
