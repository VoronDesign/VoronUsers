<h1>V2.4 Front and Side skirt with switch mod</h1>

NOTE: I am by no means a CAD professional. I have only tested the 300mm^2 mods. Feel free to contact me on the Voron discord (tayto-chip) if you would like the step files.

All screw and heat-set insert holes are unchanged. Follow the manual for instructions on installation and wiring.
