# V0 LED Hinge

This modification was designed to accomodate a Neopixel Jewel (7) in the top right hinge of the front door. A channel is present in "Right Bracket LED" to allow for wiring to be ran straight down the upright extrusion, however, a notch can be cut out of the upper portion of the bracket to allow for wiring along the top right horizontal extrusion.

The lights can be controlled with an Arduino Nano, Klipper, or an Octoprint Plugin.
