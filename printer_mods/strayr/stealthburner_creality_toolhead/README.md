# Creality toolhead for stealthburner.

Not recommended but a potential pathway for e3->switchwire conversions. It's recommended to have an all metal heatbreak.

I have a [version for AB-BN](https://github.com/strayr/voron-afterburner-ender3/tree/main/AA-BN-30_toolhead) of this that i have been using extensively.

I strongly recommend longer stainless steel screws on the heather block and a V6/reprap style nozzle here, they have a longer thread and stick out less from the heater block, and unscrewing the heat break a little to accommodate these can move the heater block further away form the printed parts of the toolhead.

## Bill of Materials
* one front part and a rear that matches your extruder
* 4x standard 5mm heatset inserts (two extra)
* 2x M3x18 SHCS
* 2x M3x12 SHCS

## Assemble as per photos and stealthburner manual
