# A ptfe tube arm utilizing a F695 bearing
### Remixed from https://github.com/GalvanicGlaze/Voron_Mods/tree/main/Trident%20Bowden%20tube%20PTFE%20guide

The M5 screw used to hold the arm to the mount kept backing because it was rubbing so I threw a flange bearing in it so that I would not have to tighten the bolt down after every few hours. I tweaked the mount so that there is a bit of a gap between the arm and mount but the bearing contacts the mount.
