This is a low profile raspberry pi camera mount for the Voron 0 / Voron 0.1.

## TLDR
1. Raspberry pi camera mount for the voron 0 / voron 0.1
2. Get up close and personal with the nozzle & the print bed (>80% visible)
3. Easy mounting with 1 M3x16 screw, 1 M3 nut and 1 M2x6 screws
4. **NO PRELOADING OF NUTS** thank goodness!
5. **No supports** as always!

## Long Story
Ever since building my Voron 0.1, I've been trying to find a good mount for a raspberry pi camera. That said, most solutions I have found are a bit too conspicuous for my taste (i.e. they stick out into the tophat area), with no direct line of sight to the nozzle.

That's why I've decided to design my own and I've found a nice spot towards the top of the left z-extrusion with just enought clearance. It also offers good visibility of the nozzle & bed, extremely easy mounting, and great cable management!

Let me know what you think!

## Notes
- Clearnace is quite tight (see one of the attached images), so I'd highly recommend that you check for inteference before commencing any prints. You can do so by moving the x-axis by hand along the back of the print bed. I'd also suggest that you check for any stray hotend wires so they don't snag on the camera
- Material choice is up to you, but if you're an enclosure (as I do), I'd highly recommend you print this model using ABS.
