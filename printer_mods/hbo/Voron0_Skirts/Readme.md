Right now there are 3 variations for the and one commmon rear.
To start with the rear ..

## Rear Skirts

The rear skirts match all the different front skirts and have the following features

- integrated power inlet mount. To be used with the "standard" v0 power inlet
- 2 keystone mount to get acces to the raspery ports
- bowden clip mount support. Disigned for the E3D style bowden clips. This allows to push the fillament and not the tube from the outside. Read for the rabit feader :)

## Waveshare 4.3" Display

This version is desiged for the Waveshare 4.3inch Capacitive Touch Display for Raspberry Pi, DSI Interface
The mounts are desihed to bolt on the frame and display with original screws from the back.
Therfore similar 4.3 inch display might not work without modifications
I'm using a 60cm DSI cable to connect the diplay with a Raspery back on the back of the V0 
(a Raspberry Pico mount mod is in preparation)

### Reset / Emergency switch
The fron display mount also provide a mounting option for a reset or inmergency switch.
I'm using this switch to reset a BTT PSU relays. 

The switch in the cad is a standard 7mm momentray switch that is easy to source even from local providers.
Make shire to get a Normal OPEN switch if you plan to use it with the BTT PSU Relays.
(A Relays mount and firmware configs are in preparation)

## Printing

All parts print with standard Voron print setting without any supports.
All parts fit on a V0. However the max out the build volume on the z axis.
If you need to print on a V0 make shure that you bed springs are really stiff by adding more tention with washers etc.
I had some problems getting nice parts out of the V0 due to the nozzle mooving he part dur to flex on the bed springs.
