## Overview

This holds 4 221-412 WAGO Mounts for cleaner AC wiring of the heated bed on the VO. It fits nicely into the recess between the two Rear bed Mounts. It allows for quick replacing of the fuse should it ever need to be replaced or removing the bed. The bed thermistor wiring isn't included, so I used a MOLEX connector for that.

## Installation

Remove the front bed mount part, slide in two M3 nuts replace the bed mount and secure with two M3x6 BHCS or SHCS

## Required Hardware

1x Printed Part
2x M3 Buts
2x M3x6 BHCS or SHCS
