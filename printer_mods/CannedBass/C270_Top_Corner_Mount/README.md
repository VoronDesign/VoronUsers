# Logitech C270 Top Corner Mount

![](images/image1.png)

Bracket to mount a C270 in the top corner of a V2.
This technically works with a Trident too, but I found that it put the camera too close to the gantry to get a good field of view.

The camera hinge connection is borrowed from [Fiction](../../Fiction/C270_Mount/readme.md).
See that readme for a description of how to mount the camera using the stock pin and screw.
