# Voron v0 Hex Deck Mod

## Why?

It might actually be harder for most people to cut a sheet of plastic with holes than to print one. 
This design takes inspiration from the Voron v0 skirt hexagons and uses it as a time reduction/design element 
for a 3d printed deck. 

## Tested Version

The tested version was printed on a Prusa 2.5 and standoffs were needed. 

## Current Versikon

has not been tested but 'should' accept 8 and 10mm screws with square nuts without protruding into the deck surface.
