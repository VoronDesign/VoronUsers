# Voron v2.4 Z Idler shoulder bolt modification

Nothing too special, just some small tweaks to the OEM shape to allow for the shoulder bolt. There's a cross-section drawing of the modifications I did, and I used the McMaster-Carr part number: 90265A113 - a 5x20mm shoulder bolt (m4 threaded). You can also purchase them through [Filastruder](https://www.filastruder.com/products/shoulder-screws-bolts?_pos=7&_sid=b4b266eda&_ss=r), they are the cheapest source.

There's a right and left version so that the bolt heads appear symmetrical - you can use as you see fit.

Print via normal Voron parts settings - nothing special or even that different here.

No 6mm version because who does 6mm Z belts? Also, I stole the original model from the Voron F360 model and 9mm is what I got. Apologies to the 6mm Z Belt Crowd.

Enjoy

Jason
