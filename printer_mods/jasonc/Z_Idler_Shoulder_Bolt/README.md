# Voron v2.4 Z Idler shoulder bolt modification
Nothing too special, just some small tweaks to the OEM shape to allow for the shoulder bolt. I speced this using the McMaster-Carr part number: 90265A113 - a 20mm shoulder bolt - you can also purchase them through Fillastruder.

There's a right and left version so that the bolt heads appear symetrical - you can use/install as you see fit.

Print via normal Voron parts settings - nothing special here.

Enjoy
