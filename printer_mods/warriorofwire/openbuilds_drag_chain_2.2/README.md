## Why
* Drag chains with a snap open side are a joy to work on.
* It looks awesome.
* I hate printing chains for myself and these are _cheap_.

## BOM
* Some M3x6 screws
* Some M3 nuts
* A few M5 screws that are a couple millimeters longer than the M5's on the gantry.  You'll figure it out.
* [3x Openbuilds 10x15mm 18mm radius Drag Chains](https://openbuildspartstore.com/drag-chain-cable-carrier/)

## STLs
File | Note
---- | ----
x_carriage_mount | You screw your drag chain's floppy end to this side.  You might need the +10mm version, print both just in case.
xy_bridge | You screw your drag chain's floppy end to this side.  Wires go through it and up into the Y chain.
a_corner_tube | Keeps your wires from touching the rail, frame, side covers and belt.
upper_z_mount | You screw your drag chain's floppy end to this side.  This holds a_corner_tube
lower_z_mount | Mounts to the rear lower frame.  You'll need to cut an L shaped slot into your bottom panel.  Also a great spot to run your bed and heater wires down through.  Move this on the rail until you get a little tension on your Z chain.  That'll keep it tight and it will look awesome.

## Known Issues
* None
