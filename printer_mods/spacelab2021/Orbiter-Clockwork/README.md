# Orbiter Clockwork Module
This Clockwork module allows the use of the Orbiter v1.5 Extruder in the Voron Afterburner.

## Features
One of the main issues I observed when using the orbiter was a lack of a quick filament release in additional to a lack of a suitable clockwork adapter that would swap an orbiter directly into the Afterburner ecosystem. Many of the issues observed were addressed with this Clockwork Module. This version provides a chain anchor for the Voron 2.4 and the Switchwire, a Cable Cover, and a quick filament release lever.
