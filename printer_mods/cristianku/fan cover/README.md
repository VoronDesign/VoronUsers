# Voron Skirt Fan Low Noise Modification

## Reason:

- The Original Skirt Fan covers make whistle if the airflow is over a certain level

- Normally the solution was to use Noctua, that are for sure quite but dont solve the problem at the root, the whistle is coming from turbulence with the airflow and the fan cover
