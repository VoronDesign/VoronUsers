# Bed Support Alignment Tools for Voron 2.4

This repository contains .stl files for the bed support alignment tools for each of the standard Voron 2.4 builds. The bed support alignment tools will assist in helping align the "bed support extrusions" to the frame.  The Voron assembly manual does not state where the "bed support extrusions" should be placed, so I created this very simple tool that you can 3D print. When the alignment tools are placed in all four corners of the Voron 2.4 Printer's frame the "bed support extrusions" will butt up against these tools so that you can screw the "bed support extrusions" down to the printer's frame in the correct position.  For completeness, I also created a piece that you can place in between the two "bed supports extrusions" as a second way to check to see if everything is correctly placed.
