This is for a dual LED light bar setup.  Step files are included for your own modification.
The LED cutouts may need to be modified depending on the dimensions of your light bar.
Designed to be mounted at the front of the Voron so the lights don't blind you when looking inside :)
Could be mounted anywhere though.
