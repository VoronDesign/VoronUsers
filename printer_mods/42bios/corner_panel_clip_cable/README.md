Corner panel clip with a internal cable path, so you can route the cables around the panel and corner.<br>
I use them to mount 6mm floatglas as top panel with 3mm foamtape<br>
<br>
corner_panel_clip_top_4mm.stl is 4mm and corner_panel_clip_bottom_3_5mm.stl is 3.5mm hight, so at the end there is 7.5mm space for the panel and foamtape.<br>
Needs 2x M3x12 screews to mount per clip.<br>
