### How to print Accent colored Logo
The "Deck_Panel_with_Logo.zip.amf" contains two STLs, one being the Voron logo 0.4 height and 60Â° sides (2 layers), the other being the deck panel without the Logo. You can print the logo first in your accent color, change filament and print the main color over it <b>without touching the bed</b> in between. Deactivate fans for overhands and put overhang flor to 100% to get a proper adhesion between the two prints. Also put z-Hop to 0.2 mm (perfect world) or 0.4 mm (safe side) for the main color print. no not crash the nozzle into the accent color.
