### Overview

Remix of the crew mods deck panel that use heat inserts instead of stand-offs. Allows inserts 5 mm x 6 mm (shorter also works).

### Print with accent colored logo
The "Deck_Panel_with_Logo.zip.amf" contains two STLs, one being the Voron logo cut out with 0.4 height at 60Â° (2 layers). You can print the logo first in your accent color, change filament and print the main color over it without touching the bed in between. Deactivate fans for overhands and put overhang flor to 100% to get a proper adhesion between the two prints. Also put z-Hop to 0.2 mm (perfect world) or 0.4 mm (safe side) for the main color print. no not crash the nozzle into the accent color.
