### Print with accent colored logo
The "Deck_Panel_with_Logo.zip.amf" contains two STLs, one being the Voron logo cut out with 0.4 height at 60Â° (2 layers). You can print the logo first in your accent color, change filament and print the main color over it <b>without touching the bed</b> in between. Deactivate fans for overhands and put overhang flor to 100% to get a proper adhesion between the two prints. Also put z-Hop to 0.2 mm (perfect world) or 0.4 mm (safe side) for the main color print. no not crash the nozzle into the accent color.
