Then screw the board on evenly on the mounts.

Note: The mounting holes on the Spider board are very tight for M3 Screws. I drilled the holes out with a 3.2mm drill, but don't encourage anyone to do so, because - reasons.

Disclaimer: It is your printer. If you do this and something breaks or if someone gets hurt, it is fully your responsibility. I take no responsibility.
