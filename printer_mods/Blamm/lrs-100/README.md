# Meanwell LRS-100 DIN bracket

Uses 2 of the [pcb_din_clip_v2](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Trident/blob/main/STLs/ElectronicsBay/pcb_din_clip_v2_x5.stl) from the Voron Trident repository.  

Use 2 M3x6 (not longer!) to mount to the powersupply. 8mm will touch the PCB inside.  
M2x10 selftappers for assembling it to the DIN clips as usual.
