I have zero experience with RRF, but Noodle obviously knows and has done the necessary work to get both klicky and [autoZ](https://github.com/protoloft/klipper_z_calibration) working.

You can look up the firmware configuration on a Voron v2.4 for the [Klicky RRF macros](https://github.com/pRINTERnOODLE/RRF-klicky-probe-voron-2.4.git) and for the [Klicky plus AutoZ](https://github.com/pRINTERnOODLE/Auto-Z-calibration-for-RRF-3.3-or-later-and-Klicky-Probe).
