# Klicky Probe for  Vorondesign V1.8,V2.4, Legacy and Trident printers

**This is an intermediate/advanced configuration, it's recommended to first build your Voron to the stock configuration**
That way, you will be better familiarized with the concepts that are presented here and will have a much more enjoyable experience.
