Here you can find the parts that are Voron v0 specific, the green part is only on the CAD files, it's used to cut cowlings to support the integrated mount.

There is no need for supports, all the files are ready to print, they are in the recommended orientation.

The Klicky Probe consists on four different components:
- Toolhead mount
- the probe itself, found on the initial STL directory
- probe dock, found on the initial STL directory
- Frame dock mount

The recommended printing configuration are:

* initial layer height: 0,24
* layer height: 0.2mm
* bottom/top/perimeters: 4
* infill: more than 23%
* infill type: Cubic
