Part needs to be assumbled with super glue, also requires minimum 8 6x4mm disk magnets for the quick release. Multiple thinner magents can also be used if stacked together for additional pull strength.
Holes for magnets should be pressed fit if printed with .4mm nozzle, Mine were printed with .8 and they needed to be reamed for a good fit. 

You will also need to replace the 4x fan screws with longer M3x35 SHCS.
