Magnet Panel Mounts with a pre insert magnet base. .stl files for my parts as well as .step files. 
Credit to Cerulean on the Annex Discord for getting the magent frame part made, and my panel mounts are based on their original mount.

- The mounts are designed around 3mm thick foam and 3mm thick panels. It is recommended to print a test part to confirm it fits your panel before printing all of them. 
- Mounts are VHB taped to the panels. 
- Tolerances are for PLA, and magnets are a friction fit. If they fall out it doesn't matter since once it is on the panels the panel will stop the magnet from sliding out. 
- A panel rest or something for the panel to sit on at the bottom may be necessary to stop the whole panel from sliding down. If you superglue the magnet frame inserts into the 2020 extrusion, it may not be needed.
