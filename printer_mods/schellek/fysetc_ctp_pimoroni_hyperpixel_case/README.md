## Compatiblity
This display case fits the [FYSETC CTP](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002011585873.html) and since this display is a knockoff, it will probably fit the [Pimoroni Hyperpixel](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/hyperpixel-4)

## Additional hardware

### M3 Threaded Insert (x4)

### Octodash Rotation

As there is an issue to rotate the display (at least the FYSETC CTP) without a desktop environment on the Raspberry Pi 4 this workaround fixed the issue whereas adding a rotation command as a systemd oneshot didn't work.

- Follow the following [instructions](http://www.lcdwiki.com/How_to_modify_the_display_orientation-CTP(En))
- Add the following statements to `.xinitrc`
```patch
#!/bin/sh

+ export DISPLAY=:0.0

xset s off
xset s noblank
xset -dpms

+ xrandr --output DSI-1 --rotate right

ratpoison&
octodash
```
