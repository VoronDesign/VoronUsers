Little cable duct for hiding the cable. Can print with your desired color to match with your build. Integrated with zip tie mounts.

For the cable management manual, I refer to: [LDO here](http://docs.ldomotors.com/voron/voron01/wiring_guide_rev_a).

## Printed parts

There are two version:
- Standard size: if you have a large size printer I refer this.
- Small size: can print on Voron V0 bed size.

Print recommended:
- ABS
- No support needed
