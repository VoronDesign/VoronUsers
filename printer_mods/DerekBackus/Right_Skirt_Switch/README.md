# Trident Right Skirt Switch

This mod moves the power switch to the right side front panel of the skirt. I've only made the skirt for the 300mm version... if you want a different size, let me know and I'll model it.

The switch hole in the back skirt is no longer necessary. I've made a skirt that removes the hole leaving only the filtered main. [Filtered_Main_Skirt](../Filtered_Main_Skirt)

Remixed to fit the Trident from this [tayto-gp Voron 2.4 Skirt mod](../../tayto-chip/skirt_switch_mod)
