# Voron Mods

A couple things I've made to make my Voron experience more pleasureable.

### Trident

1) Right_Skirt_Switch Skirt mod to move the power switch to the right side front panel of the skirt. (300mm)
2) No_Switch_Hole_Power_Skirt Skirt mod to remove the power switch hole from the back plate, leaving only the filtered main plug. (all sizes)
