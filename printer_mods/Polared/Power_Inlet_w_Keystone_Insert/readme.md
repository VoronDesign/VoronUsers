# Power-Inlet-w-Keystone-Insert
For Voron 0.1

## Description
Adds a keystone slot for the v0.1 Power Inlet. This does not change the way the inlet mounts onto the frame. 
_This was remixed in TinkerCad, using the original v0.1 power inlet, as well as a section of the v2.4 power inlet (the keystone insert portion)._
