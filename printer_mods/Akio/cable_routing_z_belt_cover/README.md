## Improvement
Added the possibility to route cables on the bottom of the cover.
## Description
I liked the design of the old Voron 2.2 covers more than the current design so I based my mod on them.

This mod allows to route cables that are hidden in the extrusions to the bottom compartment.
To achieve that the inner part of the z belt cover is a bit thicker and a path is cut out on the bottom where cables can be routed. The overall dimensions are the same as the stock 2.2 covers.

Note: Be careful to restrict the cable in the bottom compartment so it does not rub on your z-belts.
