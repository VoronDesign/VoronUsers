# **Voron 2.4 300 Front Magnet Panel Mounting System**

Mounting system for attaching a panel to the Voron 2.4 frame using magnets, primarily intended for the front panel.

###### BOM:

1. Magnets (quantity 64): https://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=B842
2. Heat set inserts (quantity 32): https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B077CJV3Z9
3. M3 T-nuts (quantity 24), no specific brand required, I used the type I could roll into the frame.
4. 1 panel (I like polycarbonate panels for ease of drilling). I would suggest having it cut short by about 5mm on height and width of the Voron BOM panel size. This will avoid issues with tolerance attaching/removing the panel. The panels can not exceed the standard Voron BOM panel size, if they do, they will not fit into the area inside the rail magnet mounts.
5. 1/4 inch wide x 1/8th inch thick closed cell foam. This can be adhered to the panel or to the frame and will create an airtight seal of the panel to the frame when the magnets of the outer panel cover pull towards the magnets on the rail mounts.
  

###### Instructions

STL files are for the 300 size 2.4 build. In the Fusion 360 file, the design was created using parametric modeling and has a lot of predefined parameters that you can adjust to fit to your needs.

If you use different size magnets or heat set inserts you'll want to adjust the parameters for those dimensions.

The design is two parts, the magnet rail mounts which attach to the extrusion and hosts one set of magnets. 
The outer part are the panel covers which contain the remaining set of magnets and attach to the panel using M3 screws.
