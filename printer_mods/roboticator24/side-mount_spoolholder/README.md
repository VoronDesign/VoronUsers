# Side-Mount Spoolholder

 This side-mounted spoolholder can be mounted on the side of a Voron V2, V1 or Tiny-M - i.e. any of the printers built on 2020 extrusions. It attaches with a single M5 bolt and relies on the acrylic side panel for additional support. It is very robust, featuring dual contact points with the spool. Also included is a bowden tube guide which points the tube at 45 degrees out towards the spool and 20 degrees out from the vertical.

An advantage is that your printer can now be pushed all the way back to the wall and you can change filament without going behind the printer.

Two versions are provided - one designed for the LHS and one for the RHS. They are exact mirror images of each other. If you have dual extruders you could mount one on each side!

 ## BOM

You will need:
* The printed parts - choose either the LHS or RHS set
* 2 x 90mm lengths of 4mm OD PTFE tube
* 1mm thick self-adhesive foam tape
