<h2>THE FILTER SINGLE FAN MODULES</h2>

![main picture single fan](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40711977/209454922-68aa202b-2bb8-4926-8b9b-9dbafd353110.PNG)

Modification created by devsfan1830#3401 on the Voron Discord based on the CAD files for the standard spacing version.

Note, some details may not match whatever the current models are for the other variants. If you find an issue or an inconsistency, contact me via discord PM. No need to bug nate :) .

Print the same as the orginals. Note, you MUST print the left and right versions of each file. Mirroring any STL will result in misalignments. Orientation should be self-explanantory but its based on as if you were looking at your printer from the front.

The holes for the magnetic connector are based upon the aliexpress item linked in the main readme. I have noticed there may be some variances in what you receive. If something doesnt fit right, again by all means PM  me on Discord or use the CAD files to make adjustments.


<h2>IMPORTANT</h2>
IT IS STILL IMPORTANT TO NOT CONNECT THESE FANS TO THE FAN HEADERS USE A HOTEND PORT FOR DURABILTY AND TO PREVENT ACCIDENTAL DAMAGE TO THE MCU

<h2>REQUIRED PARTS</h2>

* FAN SPLITTER BOARD FROM KB3D (NOT AFFLIATED JUST LIKE THESE GUYS)

Changelog:

12/24/2022: Initial version. Not yet tested but alignment and dimensions in CAD look good. Will update this when printed and tested (within 1-2 weeks).

1/2/2023: Confirmed all components fit well and dock alignment is good. Minor update to the left side housing to remove an unintended gap. If you printed one before now, you will need to reprint ONLY the left side housing with the "Left Side Housing Fixed" STL.

1/23/2023: Added STLs and CADs for optional housings for those who prefer a fixed mount. Uses a M3 screw to hold it against the bed rails.

8/11/2023: Added a simple brace print for the single fan modules. I found it useful when using them as left and right fans in my V2.4 to keep them from being knocked off the magnetic connectors as they are not vey strong. I kept having the modules get knocked loose. It's not an issue for the middle module since that is sandwiched on both sides by bed rails. Simply print two, then with the fan modules installed, use double sided tape to stick them to the bottom plate of the printer with long flat edge pressed against the filter module
