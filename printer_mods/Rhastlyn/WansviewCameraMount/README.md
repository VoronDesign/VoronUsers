This is a mount designed for a resonably priced webcam that's an alternative to the common Logitech choices.  The mount is designed to interface with the Voron 2.4 spec extrusions and uses common mounting hardware (2x m3x8 SHCS or BHCS, 2x m3 spring nuts).

3. Install the new mount reusing the OEM hardware; position as indicated so your image is oriented correctly (note: get the screw snug enough to hold the camera in place by friction yet still allow you to make small adjustments after install).
