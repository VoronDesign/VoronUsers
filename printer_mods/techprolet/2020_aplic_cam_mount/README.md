2020 Aplic Cam Mount is a 3D printed part that is used to mount a cheapo aplic hd camera to the 2020 frame at bed level. The mount is designed to be held in place with a M3 screw and a M3 nut. Additionaly, you need 4x M3 heat inserts, 4x M3 spacers and 4x M3x6 screws for mounting the camera on the mount (pun intended).


### Files
* `aplic_cam_mount_voron_2_4_300x300.stl` - The mount STL, angled for the Voron 2.4 300x300mm geometry.
* `aplic_cam_mount.scad` - The OpenSCAD file for the mount (you can play modify the parameters for your own printer's geometry).

### Parts
The mount is designed to be used with the following parts: 
```
- 1x 3d printed 2020 Aplic Cam Mount
- 1x Aplic Webcam - 1920x1080P stripped from its plastic case
- 1x M3x10 screw
- 2x M3 nut
- 4x M3 heat insert
- 4x M3 spacer
- 4x M3x6 screws
```
### Printing
The mount is printed in the orientation that it is in the STL file. The mount should be printed with the recommended Voron settings (40% infill and 4 perimeters) in ABS/ASA. That said, I've printed mine in PETG and it still holds. No supports or mount needed
