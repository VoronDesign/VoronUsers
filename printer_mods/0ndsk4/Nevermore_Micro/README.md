# Nevermore Activated Carbon Filters - Micro Edition

Originally intended as a carbon fume filter for Voron V2, it has found its way into a multitude of other machines including variants for V0, V1, V2, and more.

## Nevermore V4

Nevermore V4 is a refinement of the V3. V4 adds a air guides, as the previous versions had the majority of air flow on just one side of the filter (most recent version has all supports removed yet again!). The cartridge lid also mounts a bit sturdier, and V4 now has separate base pieces for use with Vorons other than 2.4.

The V4 was the first official release of the Nevermore Micro to the public.

## Nevermore V5 Duo

Following the V4, the V5 Duo was released that changes the direction of air flow, better suited for when the Nevermore Micro would be placed flat on the bottom or top of the printer.

The V5 Duo also adds an additional 5015.

This repository hosts both versions, as they the same in design and function.

# Getting Started

For the most up-to-date documentation, information on the toxicity of VOCs, HEPA filter options, and more, please refer to the latest Github repository for the Nevermore Micro:

<https://github.com/Nevermore3d/Nevermore_Micro>

> **_NOTE:_** MADE FOR ABS/PC/PETG - USE A DECENTLY HEAT RESISTANT FILAMENT !!

> **_NOTE:_**: Since you are committing to fan dissection, be aware a 5015 used for a NM Micro will most likely never find a different purpose!

# Credits

The Nevermore Activated Carbon Filter was modelled in [Fusion 360](http://autodesk.com).

## Contributing

Please contribute! I'd like to incorporate VOC sensors, making the filter smart (running on low-noise mode at an acceptable VOC level, then ramp up at the end to clean more thoroughly before doors open).
