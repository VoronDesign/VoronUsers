### Description
This is an mod for the Voron 2.x skirt
* You can use two M3x6mm countersunk screws with nuts to mount it on the skirt
* There are two holes for keystone sockets for LAN and USB on the sides

I liked the mod from DC67(../../DC67/plug_panel_schaffner), but could not find the Schaffner FN286-10-06 for a reasonable price. So I designed one for the Schaffner FN284-10-06.
