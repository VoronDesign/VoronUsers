These parts are only needed if you intend on front mounting the linear rail for X travel. If you will be sticking with a top mounted linear rail these parts will not fit or will not line up properly.

It is also important to note that the linear rails for Z motion (the ones the bed attach to) will need to be moved up by ~2mm for optimal positioning.

The X Carriage design originated from the Micron and was adapted to align with my vision for this project. All credit for the original design goes to those that worked on this project: https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Micron
