Reworked deck panels for the Ender3 SwitchWire conversion for the OG Ender 3 Non-Pro version.

Based on the deck panel sketch by https://github.com/thomasfjen/enderwire_nonpro

Modifications:
 - Split each panel into 3 parts so they are printable.
 - added 3mm holes for mounting
 - Cable holes instead of cable slots
 - slightly wider for a better grip on the center Y-Axis extrusion
 - center panel extends a few mm to get a foothold near the motor
 - rear right panel has the hole moved back
 - rear left panel has the hole moved forward
