# BTT Octopus vertical mount

## Overview
This is a mount for new BTT Octopus mount for DIN rails. It mounts the board vertically to take full advantage of the fan to cool those stepper motor drivers.

Remember to use spacers and place them in between the board and mounts.

### Note: you may need to adjust your DIN rail distance, it should be snug but not too far apart that you can't release the board.
