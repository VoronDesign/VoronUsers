A remake of ryandam's Mod for a centered cable management.

You can find the original file here:
(VoronUsers/printer_mods/ryandam/Cable_management_duct)

I reinforced the slots to make it more robust.
Fits on 300X3 version of V2.4 with TFT screen.
I've added STEP and F3D files if you have to adapt the lenghts.
Or you can find me on Discord at davidauvergne#2328 if you need help.
