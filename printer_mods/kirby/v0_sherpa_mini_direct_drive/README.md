# V0 Sherpa Mini Direct Drive Mod

## Requirements
 - Printed parts included in STL
 - One fully assembled Annex Sherpa Mini (see: https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Mini-Extruder )
 
## Notes
This is a direct drive mod using the Annex Sherpa Mini. The existing pocketwatch extruder can be broken down to use the TL BMG guts, if desired, for the Sherpa Mini.

Wire routing should be merged together in the slot provided, and wires should exit behind the motor.

Note: This hotend mod is for the Dragon hotend only. Feel free to modify for V6/Mosquito if desired. Fan shrouds should be identical.
