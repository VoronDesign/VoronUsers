# TMC mount for BTT 5160T Plus

A single mount will hold a pair of 5160T Plus. Each mount is designed for direct mount to a DIN rail or use a combination of the brackets to mount to 2020 extrusion or offset the mount near your MCU. The offset mounts for the MCU include a left, right and center to allow the user to get the ideal position.

### Printing

  * Print 2 [Voron PCB DIN Clip](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/blob/Voron2.4/STLs/Electronics_Bay/pcb_din_clip_x3.stl) (Not needed for 2020 bracket)
  * Print 2 brackets per mount (optional)
  * Default Voron settings
  * No supports needed
