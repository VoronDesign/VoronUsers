# Top Corner Cable Cover with Drop Down Holes (LED Wires)
Covers cables that are running around the top corners of 2.4R2 extrusions behind the Z idlers with drop down holes around the vertical extrusions and inline holes with cutouts to keep the wire management as clean as possible.

Holes are big enough to allow 2 pin microfit connectors pass through. Works perfectly with LDO LED PCB breakout board.

**CAUTION**
Check your max Z travel as there will be some loss.
