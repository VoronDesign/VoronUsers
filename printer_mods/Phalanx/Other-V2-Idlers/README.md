# "Other" V2 Idlers
 Alternative Idlers that allow the usage of "Full-Figured" toolheads without the 10mm loss of travel at the front corners of the bed.

These idlers were developed to allow the usage of wider toolheads with the Voron V2, better align the tensioning screw to the centerline of the idler shaft, add guides to the parts to allow them to interlock and provide a robust tensioning system, all while streamlining the process of making fine adjustments to tensioning. 
I am currently running these on my machine and have not seen any performance issues.  

The idler design is ambidextrous to allow simplified batch printing. All parts are converted to stl in optimal printing orientation with quantities specified per Voron standards:

# Print Settings:
All parts should be printed to standard Voron print settings:

Note: If your printer is not properly tuned i.e. printing dimensionally-accurate parts free from functional defects, the slide mechanism WILL NOT work proerly. 

# BOM:
2 ea. 5mm OD x 45mm L pins - may need to be polished down to fit the bearings depending on source. 
4 ea. F695 bearings
4 ea. 0.5mm thick 5mm shims
2 ea. M3x35mm length SHCS - Stock 40mm may be run if not using the bolted door hinge mod. 
2 ea. M3 flat washer
2 ea. M3 nut
2 ea. Voron - standard heat set
2 ea. M3 x 16 SHCS

These components are being offered as a kit by https://formosissima.com/products/other-v2-idlers-kit

This mod also requires that you run https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/blob/Voron2.4/STLs/VORON2.4/Gantry/%5Ba%5D_z_belt_clip_lower_x4.stl
on both top and bottom as belt clips, so that the design is not handed.

Be sure to fully insert the m3 heat sink so that it doesn't interfere with the bearings!
