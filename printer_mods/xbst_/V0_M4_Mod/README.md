# M4 Mod For V0
This mod lets you mount a [Mobius 4](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Mobius-Extruder) on a [Voron 0](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0).

This mod will interfere with the rear panel if you use the printed 80T idler.
Alternatives are either using the [Powge Voron 80T pulley](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ABNQZZ), or using my no [rear panel mod](../Easy_Access_Rear_Panels_v0).

I wrote a manual for assembly. You can find that [here](./Manual.pdf).

## Printed Parts Needed in M4 Files
You need both .stl files included in the mod folder, also you need:
- main_body_mirror.stl
- latch_shuttle.stl
- [a]_latch.stl
- [a]_guidler_mirror.stl
- [a]_5x4mm_spacer.stl

## Confirmed Motors That Work
I will edit this list if more motors are confirmed working.
