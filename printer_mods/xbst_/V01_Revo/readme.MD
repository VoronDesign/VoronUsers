# E3D Revo Micro Voron 0.1 Mini Afterburner Mount
![ ](./PICS/Front_CAD.PNG)
<br>
<br>This mount required a lot of minor tweaks to the parts. The Toolhead is slightly taller (iirc 1mm). This shouldn't cause any problems with stock builds but if you have mods make sure it will work.
<br>
<br>CAD files are included if you want/need to further modify the design.
<br>
<br>Use the same fasteners used in the stock toolhead.
<br>
<br>This design was tested with the beta version (by me & other beta testers). The release version should be the same size and should work with this mount.
