## Choosing The Right Gas Spring
![ ](./Pictures/piston.jpg)

You will need a powerful gas spring. I couldn't get away with a standard furniture style 100N gas spring, so I had to buy a 350N gas spring meant to be used as a car trunk/hood gas spring. The mounting hardware with the 350N gas spring wasn't compatible with our application, so I had to use the 100N gas spring's hardware and a corner bracket. As a result I decided to include aliexpress and Amazon US links, which look compatible but not tested by me. (if you test them, let me know so I remove this disclaimer) You only need one. You can use 2, but this will mean that you need to split the deck panel to 3, and do more cuts.

You may also need a metal corner bracket, some screws, nuts and tnuts to attach. If you don't have any buy a few different styles, they are cheap, and are useful for many applications. In the picture above you can see how I attached a corner bracket to be able to mount the gas spring.

If you decide to source a different one, make sure it is at least 300N, shorter than 400mm, and has a suitable mounting system. You only need one. You can use 2, but this will mean that you need to split the deck panel to 3, and do more cuts.
