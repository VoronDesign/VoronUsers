## Choosing The Right Gas Spring
![ ](./Pictures/piston.jpg)

You will need 2 100N newton gas springs. I couldn't get away with 1, and a strong (350N) one caused too many problems, because it was too strong (enough to bend the aluminium extrusions), and it was not balanced on 2 sides.

You will also need a metal corner bracket, some screws, nuts and tnuts to attach. If you don't have any buy a few different styles, they are cheap, and are useful for many applications. In the picture above you can see how I attached a corner bracket to be able to mount the gas spring.
