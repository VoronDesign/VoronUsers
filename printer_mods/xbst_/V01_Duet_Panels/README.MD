Panels are the for fully enclosing the v0.1 and replacing the solid v0.1 panels with different ones. Internal ones feature mounting holes for a duet wifi, a raspberry pi, the buck converter and the meanwell psu (BOM one). They don't work with the mini pocketwatch. External ones should work for all builds. Rear Panel has a 120mm fan mount. They need to be 3mm thick, I used aluminium laser-cut panels. You will also need my [v0.1 Tall Leg Mod](../V01_Leg).
