This mod is to allow you to screw the front door panel (instead of VHB).

You need 6x 6mm M3 screws and 6x M3 inserts.

Designed for 3mm panels but should work with thinner panels as well, just use foam tape if the gap is too big.

Insert the M3 inserts to the handle and corner pieces.

Included drilling guides will let you drill the holes accurately. I recommend using 4mm (or whatever "freedom unit" equivalent) drill bits to allow for drilling errors.

Corner guides work for all 4 corners, handel guide should be used on the correct side.
