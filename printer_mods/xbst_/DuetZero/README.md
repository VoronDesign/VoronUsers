# DuetZero Duet2 Pi Zero Mount
![Usecase Example](./example.jpg)
This is a Raspberry Pi Zero mount intended to mount OVER a Duet 2 (DuetWifi/Ethernet) to save space. You only need longer M3 screws for Duet mounting and M2 self tappers for Pi mounting.

First mount the Zero on the piece, preferably inside as that is what is intended. Use 2 M2 self tappers for this. If the screws poke out on the other side cut the ends to prevent accidents. Then using M3 screws mount this to USB side of the Duet.

This mount is intended for a Voron 0 but should work with any other Vorons.
