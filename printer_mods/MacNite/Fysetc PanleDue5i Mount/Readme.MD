This mod is to mount a PanelDue5i by Fysetc (not the original from Duet3D) to the front of the Voron V1.8, Voron Trident and Voron 2.4

You'll need the following

- 4x BCHS M3x12 or M3x14 
- 4x M3 Threaded inserts
- 2x BCHS M5x10
- 2x M5 T-Nut
- [PanleDue 5i by Fysetc](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_AMeWVN)

Just print the 2 inlcluded STL files, insert the threaded inserts into the front piece and assemble everything. The only part which needs change are the front doors of your Voron to allow for access to the panel.
