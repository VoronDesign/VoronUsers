# Just another DIN Rail bracket for BTT Octopus board

This is an alternative DIN Rail bracket for Bigtreetech Octopus boards (Normal and Pro-HV), posted this way back in Voron Discord just never uploaded it to VoronUser Mods

Use either 2 of the old style Voron 2.4(r1)  [r1_pcb_din_clips](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/blob/V2.4r1/STLs/VORON2.4/Electronics_Compartment/DIN_Brackets/pcb_din_clip_x3.stl).
or 2of the new trident/r2 ones [r2_pcb_din_clips](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/blob/Voron2.4/STLs/Electronics_Bay/pcb_din_clip_x3.stl).

Octopus board can be secured to those bracket with M3 screw, without nuts, just gently screw them in as its ah just plastic fitting!
