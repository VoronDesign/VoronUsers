# Combined Z Chain Guide and Thermistor Mount
This is my take on the Z chain guide thermistor mount, this will hold either a glass bead thermistor or the cartridge style thermistors used in many hotends, with a screw to hold the thermistor in place. It includes concealed cable routing into the extrusion lower slot.

An M3 x 6 SHCS sits flush in the bottom hole and is tightened (gently) to hold either type of thermistor in place (not essential if you're careful but I put a small piece of heatshrink around the thermistor wires to cushion them where the screw pinches)

Upper hole takes the same M5 BHCS as the standard Z chain guide in order to fasten to a T nut, lower hole is sized to take the thermistor (cartridge or glass bead)

The thermistor cable exits through the back straight into the bottom slot on the 2020, then use extrusion slot covers such as [these](https://mods.vorondesign.com/detail/ZKJgu7OwMNB1xAKRrYSYeg) to hide them.
