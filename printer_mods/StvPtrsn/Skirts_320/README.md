<B>Voron 2.4 Bottom Skirts for a 320mm build frame.</B>

These bottom skirts have been modified to fit a 320mm build (frame footprint of 480mm x 480mm).

One nice benefit is the extra 20mm provides just enough room to add a keystone jack to the filtered mains plug panel.

What to print:<BR>
If you use the standard plug_panel or the plug_panel_filtered_mains (without added keystone jack) then print all skirt STL's as indicated in their file names.

If you use the filtered mains power plug and want a keystone jack spot then substitute in the 300mm build rear skirts.

Front View (the awesome accented front panel by <a href="https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/mjoaris/Mini12864_LCD_Mount_for_V2.4">Mjoaris</a> is shown but this works with the standard panel as well)
