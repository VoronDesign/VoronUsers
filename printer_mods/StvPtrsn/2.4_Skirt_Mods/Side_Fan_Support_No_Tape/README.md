<B>Side Fan Supports with Integrated Fan Mounting</B>

Without deviating from the original design this is what I came up with as an alternative to mounting the side fans with tape.

To mount a 60mm fan sandwich the mounting tabs on the side_fan_support between the fan_grill and fan.  Note the orientation of the grill, there are recesses for the mounting tabs.  Use fan_grill_washer with M2x16mm screws to secure the fan in place.  Take care not to overtighten or it will strip.

To mount a blank insert sandwich the mounting tabs between the 60mm_fan_grill and fan_grill_retainer using M2x6mm screws.

60mm_fan_emptygrill provided for those who prefer nothing in front of the fan.
