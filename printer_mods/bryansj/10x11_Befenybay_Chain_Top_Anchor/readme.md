This is a mount for the Befenybay (and maybe other) 10mm x 11mm Drag Chain from Amazon found here https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QLGWQ1L (10mmx11mm-Outside Open).

These are to replace the similar parts of the Zip Chain installation.

The part may need to be mirrored depending on the application.  One half has smaller holes that you will screw into and the other will have clearance holes for M3.
