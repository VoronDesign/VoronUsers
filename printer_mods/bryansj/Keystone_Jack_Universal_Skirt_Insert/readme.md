This is a universal keystone jack insert for the hexagonal holes in the Voron skirts.  I didn't want to have to print a new skirt and wanted the ability to insert it at any location.

You need to break off the upper tab of your keystone jack.  The bottom of the jack still has a locking ridge that snaps into the bottom of the insert.  Go ahead and wire your keystone jack.  Push the insert into one of the hexagonal holes in the skirt.  Insert the jack from behind.  The jack will push the side locking tabs of the insert into place.  Keep pushing and you should hear the jack snap into place.

If your jack is different and doesn't want to fit then trim off the lower locking feature of the insert and epoxy it into place during installation and let cure.
