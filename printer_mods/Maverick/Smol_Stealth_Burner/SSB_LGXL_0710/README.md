# Smol Stealth Burner - LGX Lite / Dragon

## Goal
To create an efficient process of toolhead maintenance / swapping.

## Key Notes
- Compatable with MGN9, feel free to adapt to your specific needs
- Shroud and Fans make up a "component"; zip tie fan wires to the shroud
- Adapter, Hotend, and Extruder make up a component; zip tie wires accordingly
- Magnets are used to hold the toolhead in place while screws are removed

## Moving Forward
I will no longer continue development on this specific version as I place my focus on enhancing the design.
