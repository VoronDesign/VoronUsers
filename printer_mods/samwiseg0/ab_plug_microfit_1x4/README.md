# Voron 2.4 AB Plug (Microfit 1x4)
This mod is to add a plug to the gantry to connect the A & B motors. These mount on the underside of the rear extrusion facing the motors themselves. There are 2 different designs. One that supports a Microfit 3.0 1x4 with panel mount ears and the other is _without_ panel mount ears.

Both these plug types have been found on the Lineo harneses. Check which one came with your harness before printing.

It may take some work to get the connector to fit.

**Pro tip: If you would like the screws to be facing the rear of the printer you can mirror the model in your slicer.**
