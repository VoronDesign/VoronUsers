# Voron 2.4 AB Plug (Microfit 1x4)
 This mod is to add a plug to the gantry to connect the A & B motors. There are 2 diferent designs. One that supports a Microfit 3.0 1x4 with panel mount ears and the other is _without_ panel mount ears.

 Both these plug types have been found on the Lineo harneses. Check which one came with your harness before printing.

 **Pro tip: If you would like the screws to be facing the rear of the printer you can mirror the model in your slicer.**
