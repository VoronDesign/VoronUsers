# Voron RaspberryPi Bootscreens
![](Images/boot_tile.png)

More in the images folder! Feel free to reach out to me on discord [Samwiseg0#4034](https://discord.com/users/210122378317922308). I will be happy to customize the serial number on any of the splash screens.

 ## How to remove the text and logo on raspbian buster

 Start by removing all the default screens and also the Raspberry images. Also, disable all the bootup lines.

 Edit `/boot/config.txt` to remove the color test/rainbow screen.

 ```cmd
 sudo nano /boot/config.txt
 ```

Add:
```cmd
disable_splash=1
```
Press **ctrl+X, Y for save and Enter** to return to the command line.

Edit `/boot/cmdline.txt`
 ```cmd
sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
```
Add the following to the end of the first line

```cmd
logo.nologo consoleblank=0 loglevel=1 quiet vt.global_cursor_default=0
```

* `logo.nologo` - Remove the Raspberry logo.
* `consoleblank=0 loglevel=1 quiet` - Disable the commands and various bits of the kernel
* `vt.global_cursor_default=0`- Removes the blinking cursor before the image loads.

Press **ctrl+X, Y for save and Enter** to return to the command line.

Remove the login prompt by running
```cmd
sudo systemctl disable getty@tty3
```

## Add the new splash screen

To make the image readable install `fbi`. `fbi` is a frame-buffer image viewer.

Install `fbi`
```cmd
sudo apt install fbi
```

It will take a few seconds to install. After this we have to
create a file by

```cmd
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/splashscreen.service
```

Add the following:

```cmd
[Unit]
Description=Splash screen
DefaultDependencies=no
After=local-fs.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/fbi -d /dev/fb0 --noverbose -a /home/pi/boot-image.png
StandardInput=tty
StandardOutput=tty

[Install]
WantedBy=sysinit.target
```
 * `-d/dev/fb0` - Tells `fbi` which image to display.

 * `--noverbose` - Suppresses `fbi` ‘status bar’ at the bottom.

 * `-a` - If the selected image is in the proper measurements then no editing is required if not then “-a” will act as editor.

 * `StandardInput`/`StandardOutput`  - Allows `fbi` get access to tty.

 * `DefaultDependencies` -  will override the systemd’s default behavior.

 * `fbi` will be loaded in the boot process when `WantedBy` is accessed, not before the file system (and hence image) are ready, through the `After` option.

Place the image on the pi and name it `boot-image.png`. The image should live in the main home directory for the `pi` user. The full path for the image is `/home/pi/boot-image.png` **You may use another name but you must change it in the systemd file above.**

You can find a basic guide on how to conect to the pi and transfer a file [here](https://howchoo.com/pi/how-to-transfer-files-to-the-raspberry-pi). Note that when you connect to your pi via any of these methods the default location is `/home/pi/`. You should be able to just drop the file into the default directory after connecting.

Enable the service by running
```cmd
sudo systemctl enable splashscreen
```

Now reboot the Raspberry Pi and verify your image by

```cmd
sudo reboot
```

fin.
