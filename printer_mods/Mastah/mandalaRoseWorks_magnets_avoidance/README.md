# Magnets avoidance

This configuration allow owners of mandalaroseworks mag bed to avoid probe right over them during bed mesh calibration.

## Bed supported

So far only the 355 x 355 bed is supported. Feel free to use the same computation as I did to make your own avoidance zone.

## Exclusions zones

The exclusions zones are squares of 28mm x 28mm on the center of each magnets.
