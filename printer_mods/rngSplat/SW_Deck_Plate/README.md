# Printable deck plate for Switchwire
I don't have easy access to the tools for precisely cutting ABS sheets, but I figured I could print them pretty well if I split and dovetailed them. I added a debossed voron logo, for style.

All STLs are oriented face down. I printed in ABS with a brim. Trim the brim and join the halves together. Depending on your material choice, use the adhesive of your choice. You can also just secure them to the rails and have the dovetail hold them together, since they aren't moving parts.

Print settings aren't crucial, but the deboss is 0.6mm, so 0.2 or 0.3 should work just fine if you plan to do the logo in a different color.
