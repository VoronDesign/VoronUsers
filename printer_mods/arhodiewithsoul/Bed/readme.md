Contains z_motor_mounts for off-spec 180mm (eg. Prusa Mini) and 200mm bed sizes. The specified z_motor_mounts for a vanilla build are too wide and interfere with the z_shaft_retainers either side. The narrower z_motor_mounts included here will allow for a minimum bed size of 180x180mm when using the Voron v1.8 Configurator.

Please note that bottom_skirt_middle infills will also need to be created to fill the gap (assuming a user uses the standard 250mm skirts). Skirt STLs for a 200x200mm bed are included in the Bottom_Skirts folder (skirt_200_middle).
