# Cable Port Flush Mount Skirt

Provides an inlet to mount BATIGE circular cable adapter ports on the rear
center skirt (250, 300, and 350) allowing easy access to display and USB headers
of the raspberry pi.

It can be used for quick access to Raspberry Pi ports often out of reach
underneath the printer without needing to flip over the printer.
