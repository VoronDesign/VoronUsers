# Guide for an umbilical with top feed, no cable gland required

I added a toolhead board to my Galileo extruder, and the reduced wire-count suggests to move to an umbilical instead of an energy chain. This mount guides a sleeved wire bundle. My umbilical enters the chamber at the top, through the exhaust opening, and is supported by a gallows. It needed a steady mount at the extruder. 

This has no hardware requirements. I put the wires into a standard polyethylene sleeve to protect the wires.

The toolboard is an EBB36 mounted with https://www.printables.com/model/261263-voron-stealthburner-galileo-ebb36-side-mount
