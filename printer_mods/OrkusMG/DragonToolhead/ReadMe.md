# Triangle Lab Dragon Hotend Toolhead

This toolhead mount design is based of Voron 2.2 Toolhead files.

It is one piece print, designed to work with everything you have included in you Dragon Hotend delivery package (screws and bowden collete) - no additional extra parts required.

For printing I advice using bit of support for the face marked in blue visible on the Back picture below.
