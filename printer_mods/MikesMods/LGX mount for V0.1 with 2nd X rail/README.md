V0.1 mod for mounting Bondtech LGX extruder with addition of 2nd X rail on the back of the 1515 extrusion. 
Already tested the rigidity of the 2nd rail and there is no up and down tool head movement as with just one. 

Few additional screws are needed:
X bumper 1x M3x10 or 1x M3x12
Y Bumper 1x Mx6

Strain Relive 2x M3x8
Carriage Backplate 1x M3x6, 1x M3x8, 4x M2x6

A Motor Mount 1x M3x8
B Motor Mount 1x M3x8

Cowling 2x M3x30 (LGX mount)
The LGX Interface Plug is integrated in the Cowling 

LGX Extruder 2x M3x16 (bottom of the extruder)

The Carriage Backplate can be optional mounted with 3 M2x16 screws to the carriage, the holes are covers and need to be cut out. It is not necessary to use them, there is enough righty as the backplate is directly mounted to the LGX stepper.
