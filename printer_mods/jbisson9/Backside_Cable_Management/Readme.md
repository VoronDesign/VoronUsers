This is alternative wiring management solution to current methods.  And it was fun to design :)  The idea was to terminate cable within the channel with microfit connectors for easy maintenance.  Guides are used underneath to secure the wiring.  An optional screw and heat set insert are used to secure the system in place if needed.  Currently designed for V2.4 350mm.  CAD will need modification to work with other size and types of printers.

Note microfit connectors are pressure fit with specials retention jigs.

The BTT smart filament sensor fits into the printed part.  This is a remix from an unknown design listed on teamfdm.com (thanks!)

The system makes use of the keystone skirt, normally for USB/Rasp Pi connections, but in this case two microfit connectors are pressure fit into the slots

# BOM
* 4x M3 x 12 SHCS
* 4x M3 Hammerhead T-Nuts
* BTT filament sensor
* 2-, 3- and 5-circuit microfit 3 connectors

## Printing

Print what you need.  Uses standard Voron print profiles but the BTT was better when using supports (sorry first design and don't have all my sh*^Y#t together)

## Assembly
First print out "Cut tool", check fans compatibility, if fit is acceptable remove fans top body part and cut lower part according to “Cut tool”. Insert fans into “Back piece” (adjust fit if needed by cutting additional plastic from lower fan body). Fans should hold firmly in back part. Close them with “front piece” and secure them using “logo piece” using m3x20 SCHS screw.

### Optional
If you want to secure the entire system to the panel, use a heat set insert and backer.  The panel is only 3mm thick so you'll need something to secure the rest.
