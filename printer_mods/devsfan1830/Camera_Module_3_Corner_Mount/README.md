Based off the mount submitted here: https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/richardjm/picam-corner

I had to model my own because this V3 cam seems to be smaller than the past versions. It rattled around alot in richardjm's model. So, using it as inspiration I modeled a snugger fitting holder specific to this camera. Depending on printer tolerances, a sliver of kapton tapoe on the edges of the pcb may be needed to really snug it up.
See the images folder for installed look and view. I have provided an stl to use for either side. CAD provided if you want to model a tighter fit as well.
