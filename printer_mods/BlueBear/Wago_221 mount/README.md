# Snap-In Wago Mounts for 1515 extrusions

## Overview

This mod is derived from [wago_221_mount](../../../legacy_printers/printer_mods/GSL12/wago_221_mount) and brings in some 
mounts for the Wago 221 terminals (2 contacts) to clip and to screw.

## Wago-Mount for screws
I use this mount [WAGO_221-411_3x2-mount_screw.stl](./WAGO_221-411_3x2-mount_screw.stl) at the power inlet to distribute the power to pad/ssr and the PSU.

## Snap-In mounts
The snap-in mounts can be easily attached and removed from the extrusions. For using that mount print the desired stl
([WAGO_221-411_3x2-mount.stl](./WAGO_221-411_3x2-mount.stl) or [WAGO_221-411_5x2-mount.stl](./WAGO_221-411_5x2-mount.stl)
together with at least two of the mounting clips([LDO](./1515_SnapIn_LDO.stl) or [MakerBeam](./1515_Snapin_Makerbeam)).

Don't rotate the clips, they must be printed upright, as shown in the picture.

Otherwise the clips might break upon inserting into the extrusion.

Glue the clips into the appropriate places of the mount and let it cure before use.

Both mounts fit very well into the Z-Extrusions of the V0:
