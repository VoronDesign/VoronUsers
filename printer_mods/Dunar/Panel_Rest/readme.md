Part needs to be assumbled with super glue, also requires minimum 8 6x4mm diameter disk magnets for the quick release. Weaker or thinner magents can be stacked for additional pull strength.

I was able to print everything standing upright without supports with 0.8mm Volcano, some steep overhangs on rear body will be ugly, but those parts can be trimmed off since it is a glue surface and not visible when assembled.
