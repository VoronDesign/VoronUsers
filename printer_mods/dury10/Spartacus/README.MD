### Hello Everyone 

This is my take on building a small toolhead:
A project I have been working on for more than a year. It all  started when Voron Design launched V0.2 with the Mini StealthBurner
I liked that toolhead a lot but I wanted more. 
More Flow, more cooling and more features like LED and this is how i ended with CN3D 4010 Mini StealtBurner.
I always liked the idea to get out the most from anything I encounter.  I looked for a way to be on the budget and to achieve better quality and reasonable speeds. 
I will not talk more about the last year project but it’s important to let you know how I got to Spartacus!

After I managed to add in MSB everything that in my opinion was missing I thought “what if i’d have all of these in a smaller and lighter form?”. And this is how I ended up with a lighter  and narrower toolhead.

### Who is this Toolhead for? 

This is for someone who wants a light toolhead that looks good ,without messy cables,  tidy and has visible and lighted nozzle, that you can build with off the shelf components that doesn’t require a lot of money. 
I found a solution for every situation i have encountered on my journey to print fast on a budget. 

### Now, to correct what i said :
I didn’t crafted all the parts that I have used to create this toolhead. I just tested a lot to find the cheapest version to achieve  the results I was aiming for. 


### I got a lot of questions about the difference from the stock design. 

- It has bigger part cooling fans. I went further and I removed the cover from the fans and used the cowling as a fan cover.
- It has 2 neopixels.
- It has built in cable management and covers to hide all the messy spaghetti.
- It has passive cooling for the stepper motor, and all the flow/air from the hotend fan is routed to go up out of the build plate.
- It has different position for the idler gear to reduce some artifacts.


### It can be installed on any Voron v2.4 or trident or any other 3d printer that uses this gantry style. 


### The design goal:
- to have all of the above in less than 320 grams 
- to have a minimum flow of 35mm3/s and all the parts used to build this toolhead to be less than 120Euros.
