# Disclamer

This is a clone of the [Kirigami repository](https://github.com/christophmuellerorg/voron_0_kirigami_bed) to allow to find the mod in the voron mod database. I try to keep it updated, but there is a chance this copy is slightly outdated at times.

# What is this?

A laser cut and bent single piece bed concept, trying to implement a lightweight and stiff bed with full access to the mounting screws similar to the flatbed concept, but ditching the printed plastic parts

# Isnt't this expensive?

Lasercutting is surprisingly cheap - I got offers for manufacturing in small series for prices similar to the cast and machined bed which is mounted on top. Note that additional surface treatment steps will add to the cost.

# Where can I get it? 

I only did a small prototype run and will not be able to sell it myself, however there are a few Voron related shops that started stocking it:

The guys from Maple Leaf Makers made a nice tutorial on how to convert the stock bed to Kirigami.
