Electronics Bay and Chamber seperator.

A plate to seperate the enclosure, from the electronics compartment. The chief advantage in using this part, is it allows you to drastically 
reducde the size of the back panel, while maintaining chamber temperature. This wouuld allow you to run a larger extruder if desired. It also 
will help to keep the Raspberry Pi running cooler, and even for active cooling for the electronics or stepper motors should you deem it
necessary.

I aimed to create something easy to install on a machine already built. Also easy to remove for maintenance or modifcation.
