## v2.4 300mm BOM:
- [4mm rods](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32297671032.html?spm=2114.13010708.0.0.3a994c4dbA1iDS) (2 x 41mm)
- 6mm rods (4 x 448mm) 
- 4x [LM6UU linear bearing](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32815449673.html?spm=a2g0s.8937460.0.0.12852e0eL5v9BS) (6mm ID, 12mm OD, 19mm length) 
- 4x [HK0408 needle bearing](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000273016481.html?spm=2114.13010708.0.0.3a994c4dbA1iDS)

- 8x M3x16 sockethead
- 8x M3 T-nuts
- 4x M3x10 or m3x12 sockethead (To secure the door ; This depends on the thickness of your panel)
- 4x M3 hex nuts (To secure the door)
- 4x M3 washer (To secure the door)

## Info:

The print parts are intended for PLA (ABS shrink not accounted for), and a total panel thickness of 6mm. This includes the foam gasket.
So different configurations are possible e.g. 4mm door panel + 2mm foam, or 3mm door panel + 3mm foam.
I intentionally undersized it by 0.3mm to compress the foam and ensure airtightness.
For those of you without foam gaskets, I have included a "NoFoamGasket" version for 3mm thick panels.


I have tried a 2x 6mm rod version of this concept. 
The door (mine is 4mm thick) is too heavy and causes the bottom linear bearing to slide away which not only looks bad , but also does not make it easy to slide the door back as you have to lift it just right.
Even with the 4 6mm rods the problem persists just a tiny bit. 
I solved this by securing the bottom-back two rodholders by a few millimeters to create a slight racking/binding.
For 250 and 350 sized v2 Vorons it should suffice to subtract or add 50mm to the 6mm rods. The 350 could have increased weight problems though.

I have not tried double doors with 2 rods on each side. 
I suspect this would work somewhat better but still have some weight problem. 
This might be solved by using a longer, or multiple LM6UU bearings as there would be plenty of room to slide them back.

Please let me know on the Voron discord if you tried any variation of my mod. I'd love to see what you come up with!
