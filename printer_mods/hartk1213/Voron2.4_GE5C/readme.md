#### Notes about IGUS bearings

You can replace the GE5C bearings with IGUS models. There are two IGUS spherical bearings types: the `KGLM` and `EGLM` series. The EGLM are compatible with the files found in the `Z_Joints` folder, the KGLM require the files located in `Z_Joints/Phalanx`.

Now if you are using the "No Endstops" version you need 4 m3x16 screws per z joint, if you are using the endstop/halleffect version then you need 4 m3x20 per z joint.

This is how it should be assembled when all done



### NOTE: To address the question on whether to use the offset or non-offset pieces

* if you are building a new printer using the ge5c mod, then i recommend the offset parts

* if you are just installing these in a currently built printer then the stock non-offset parts are fine
