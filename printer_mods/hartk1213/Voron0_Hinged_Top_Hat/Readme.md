# Hinged Hat for the V0

This is my new design for a fold away hinged top hat for the V0, i have included the step file for all the parts i designed, as well as added a BOM for everything you need to get in order to build this, 

assembling is pretty straight forward what i did first was attach the bottom hinge pieces to the top of the V0 first and then build the middle hinge assembly, next you can assemble the main top hat frame.
i found it easier to assemble it from the back of the top hat forward. if you open the step file you can see how it assembles. i have tested this quite a bit and so far its been working great! please feel free to make any modifications to it as you see fit

this is my biggest project ive ever taken on in fusion 360 and it was a lot of fun learning the ins and outs of it


i hope you enjoy it
