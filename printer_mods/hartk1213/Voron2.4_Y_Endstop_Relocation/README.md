This mod is for the V2 A Drive to go along with [Arkeets MGN12](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/arkeet/mgn12) mod that has the X endstop on the toolhead 
and that is moving the Y endstop to the A drive this requires a 2pin jst to be soldered to the switch, 
the best way i have done it is to solder the wires to the jst first, then install it with a dab of super glue , then solder the wires to the omron switch

you might need to bend the pins a little bit to get them to fit around the curve
