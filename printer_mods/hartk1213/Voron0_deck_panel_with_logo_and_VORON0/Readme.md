# Deck Panel for V0 to include the Voron logo and the VORON0 name 

i used user @Kruppes blank deck panel to make my own to include the logo as well as the words it uses 3 colors hence the 2nd accent label on the 3rd stl [b],
i used black for the base, red for the logo and gray for the "0" in VORON0

the easiest way i found to print it was to use simplify3d and select all the models and then shift-click align models, what this does it is uses the "Align model origins" feature which places 
all the stls exactly where they need to go, once you do that you can just remove the parts you are not printing and slice each color separately. i ended up with 3 files and i printed them in 
the following order after each print is finished just change filament and start the next print without removing first parts

1. [b]_Voron0_deck_panel_0
2. [a]_Voron0_deck_panel_ Logo
3. Voron0_deck_panel_with_logo_and_VORON0
