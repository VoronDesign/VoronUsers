# SexBolt Z endstop 
![1](Images/9.png) 

This an alternative way to do the Z endstop pin in a V2, instead of using a deflanged GT2 20T pulley, it uses 2  5x7x8 sleeve copper bearings/bushing 
this is pretty simple to assemble. The reason behind this is to help keep the pin from falling out.

First just insert two of the sleeve bearings into the top, they should bottom out with about 2mm or so poking out the top

Next insert the female side of a 5mmx20mm chicago screw (sex bolt, binding barrel) and screw in the M4x6 or M4x8 SHCS with some loctite to make sure it doesn't move over time
