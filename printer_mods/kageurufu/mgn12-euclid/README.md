This is a modified version of the MGN12 carriage for a Voron Trident or modded Voron 2.4 with a cutout for mounting the upper Euclid PCB.

Other than requiring a Euclid Probe, the only additional parts needed for the MGN12 carriage are two M3 heatset inserts for mounting the upper PCB. 

For the Trident, the probe itself can be mounted [fixed onto the gantry](https://github.com/nionio6915/Euclid_Probe/tree/main/stls#:~:text=Voron%202.4%20Frame%20Mount)

On a V2.4, you have the choice of [gantry mounting](https://github.com/nionio6915/Euclid_Probe/tree/main/stls#:~:text=Voron%202.4%20Frame%20Mount) or [fixed bed mounting](https://github.com/nionio6915/Euclid_Probe/tree/main/stls#:~:text=Voron%202.4%20Bed%20Rail%20Mount). The fixed mounting has the benefit of removing the chance of errantly picking up the probe after reaching a high enough Z. 

When installed, the Euclid's magnets should barely protrude from the bottom of the carriage.

The JST connector should be easily accessible from above
