- **Simple Brace Notes**
  - This is a quick and easy brace.  It decreases the x-axis resonance slightly and is very simple to install.
  - m3x25mm bolts through the upper duct arm mount and straight into the plastic of the duct brace.
- **Full Brace Notes**
  - *Just FYI, these are new parts, so I'm still polishing things.*
  - There are two versions of the full brace parts.  
    - The open motor mount version is easier to mount but may be a weaker mounting surface, time will tell.
    - The closed motor mount version is stronger, but requires you to unscrew the m3x20s during mounting of the duct.  It's not a big deal, but the option is there.  
  - I used a lock nut to clamp the duct brace to the sherpa mini motor.  This is annoying because there isn't enough space to fit a hex socket on the nut.  I'm looking into alternative ways to clamp the brace to the sherpa.
  - Yes, the rear 5015 clamp currently bolts from inside out.  The 4.5mm thick plastic + heatset clamps well and doesn't lean too much.  I'm looking into ways to have this clamp with the bolt head to the outside, but it works ok for now.  
- **Acknowledgements**
  - Thanks to Woennn for the idea for the simple duct brace.
  - Thanks to Netweaver for the idea for the A-Frame connecting the sherpa mini motor to the front duct arms.  I took his idea and added the rear 5015 support/clamps.
