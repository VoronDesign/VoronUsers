What to Print
============
****note that Voron 1.8 is only compatible with Dragon hotend at the moment.**  If you need something else just let me know and I'll work with you.

<TD><B>Print the hotend mount (Hotend_Mount_Rapido_v.03.stl or Hotend_Mount_Rapido_v.03_Rotated120Degrees.stl) that allows you to mount the Rapido hotend so that the wires come out right/forward and the logo of the sock faces directly forward</B>. <BR>Because the Rapido uses FOUR screws on the top of the heatsink, and THREE screws to mount the heater to the heatsink, the orientation of the hotend mount versus the heater wire can vary.  The Part cooling ducts for Rapido have been optimized so that the Phaetus logo on the sock should point directly forward (yes the sock is asymmetrical).  </TD>
