1.8 and Trident
============
**Notes for building on a Voron 1.8**
- You will need to cut the rearward “ears” off the 5015 fans for clearance.
  - OscarGM was able to get the standard length ducts (found in the 2.4 folder) to clear. It looked tight, but it did clear.
  - The ducts in the 1.8 folder have 2mm extra clearance, and should clear with most fans.
  - The reason 1.8 needs the ears cut is because the duct start to look ridiculously long due to the inverted nature of the 1.8 gantry.
- Acknowledgements:
  - Just wanted to thank GarretWP, OscarGM, and Koonweee for being the brave souls

**Notes for building on a Voron Trident**
- Theoretically, the Mantis using 2.4 ducts should be compatible with Trident.  However, I'm not sure if it's been tested yet.
