-----------------

 - hardware needed is a 2510 fan ( i used one of the winsinn "high speed" fans on amazon with no problem)
 - m2.5 hardware
   -  m2.5x8 (x2) should be enough for mounting the mosquito at the top (im not sure on the lengths exactly)
   - m2.5x8 (x2) should be enough for attaching the mosquito on the back. 
   - m2.5x12 or m2.5x14 (x2) for attaching the fan to the mosquito heatsink
