# ssd_bracket
bracket to mount a ssd-drive to the din rail under a voron printer

This bracket is designed to mount a ssd drive in the electronic bay of a voron 2.4 or Trident. 

The following part has to be printed x1: [pcb_din_clip_x3](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/blob/eb094399681bcac4efce723157b8638c69173cb3/STLs/Electronics_Bay/pcb_din_clip_x3.stl)


Bom:

- 1x ssd_bracket
- 1x pcb_din_clip
- 2x M2x10 self tapping screw
- 4x M3x12 SHCS

Instructions:

Use the M2x10 self tapping screws to mount the ssd_bracket to the pcb_din_clip. Then mount your ssd drive with the M3x12 SHCS to the ssd_bracket. Then snap the assembly in place on the din rail. It mounts similar to the Raspberry Pi on page 178 to 179 on the Voron 2.4r2 manual.
