 I couldn't find any U2C mounts that didn't use those horrible self tapping M2 screws so I made one that uses M3 fastners and the 5V PSU DIN clip (as that uses M3 bolts) - this design is based on [aeresov's raspberry pi DIN mount](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/aeresov/Raspberry_Pi_DIN_mount)
 
## You Can Use Either Heatsets Or M3 Hex Nuts ##
