Stealthburner Phaetus Dragon UHF and Phaetus Dragon UHF mini tool cartridge
===
With special thanks to @eamers for the Crazy dragon heatblock, as well as @bythorsthunder for the Stealthburner Rapido UHF body design the awesome base design from the VoronDesign team! 

For the regular Dragon UHF hotend with the extended melt zone, use the `SB_Dragon_UHF_TH_*.stl` and the enlarged main body `Stealthburner_Body_Dragon_UHF.stl`.
Parts were extended by 8.3mm to fit the Stealthburner Rapido UHF main body by @bythorsthunder.

If you use the Dragon UHF mini hotend (standard UHF version without the melt zone extender), use `SB_Dragon_UHF_TH_mini_*.stl` and the regular Stealthburner body.

The fan duct is designed based on the Crazy Dragon Fan Duct, allowing air to only blow towards the heatbreak.
More clearance for the heater cable was added to allow mounting the hotend in the proper direction (heater facing forward, thermistor facing backward).
Additionally, clearance for the Voron Tap (R8) screws were added.
