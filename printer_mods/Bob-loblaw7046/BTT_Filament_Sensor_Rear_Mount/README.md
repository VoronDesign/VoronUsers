# BTT-Filament-sensor-rear-mount

## Intro

I made this SFS mount because I didn't have much clearance behind my printer and I didnt wan't to kink the PTFE tubing. It also is great if you put your spool on top of or next to your printer. It's a snap fit, be careful of the cable plug clearance

I use this exhaust port cover by Fiction: https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Fiction/Exhaust_cover
