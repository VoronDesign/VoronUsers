Printed Solid sells 1/8" (3mm+), these do not work with the spec parts. I modifed all the "clamps" to accommodate 1.5mm extra (you can then shim as needed, I did not have to after carefully deburring all parts)
Printed and Tested! Makes the assembly actually fit on the printer as intended perfectly.
