I made Zen3Dlab's orignal mid panel with hex pattern compatible with the v0.1.
I've added 3 files; V01. Hex Back Panel With SKR and Pi Mount, V0.1 Hex Back Panel With SKR Mount, V0.1 Hex Back Panel No Mounts. 
Personally, I like having the mounts modeled into the part.  It's more secure than mounting the boards to the back panel with VHB tape.   
Perform your first filament swap at 0.6mm and 2.2mm
I recommend using the tabs on the model to mount the panel to the frame.  Since it's a big print it will be prone to some warping.  Mounting it to the frame will keep it flush.
