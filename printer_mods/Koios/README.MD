# LED Mounts

This is a simple LED light bar mount for 2.4, mounts in the top extrusions.

# C920 Mount

Mount a C920 at the top front of your printer, for maximum field of view and minimal space, also allows neat cable routing.

# Glass mount

Using the 2.1 panel sizes, I mounted 6mm thick tempered glass panels on my voron.  These files allow the locking latches to secure the panels to the front & sides of the printer. This works fine with 2.4.

# V0 C920 Mount
Similar to the above C920 mount, but re-engineered to fit nicely on the V0 tophat, including cable management clips.
