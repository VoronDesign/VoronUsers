Mod that replaces the motor tensioner assembly in the z drive to make it better braced and eliminates chance to rotate/twist when you tension and when the drive operates.

Unfortunately, the skirt geometry changes, so you will have to reprint the front skirts entirely. However, you only need to reprint the motor bracket and the base plate for this mod. The files are located under STLs.

For this reason, this mod is entirely OPTIONAL. Perhaps consider it if you are starting a new build or you wish to improve over the current z drives. The stock z drives are still quite stiff and will work fine if you pay attention to the way you tension.

Extra parts that you will need (2x per drive, therefore 8x in total):

- 8x M3X12mm bolts
- 8x M3X5X4mm heatset inserts (the specced ones in Vorons)
- 8x 1mm M3 washers/shims (7mm OD max, optional)

Tensioning process is the same as stock V2.4, with exception of needing to tighten down two more bolts once you are done. For the skirts, the hole placement for the bottom panel clips are shifted compared to the original. The bottom panel remains unchanged and does not need any tweaking.

In the image, the heatset inserts are inserted from the top of the motor mount; you can easily installl this from the bottom as well.
