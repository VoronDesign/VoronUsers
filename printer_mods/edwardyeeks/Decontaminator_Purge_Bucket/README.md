This is a removeable purge bucket with a brush scrubber. I noticed that the current brush scruber design of the Voron was not very effective at containing filament debris and bits.

It was also not removeable, making it a pain to reach behind and clean it out with a vacuum. So, this design aims to solve all that by:

1) Making a larger and deeper purge bucket to hold more filament gunk.
2) Purge bucket is removeable to and clips onto the brush scrubber with its geometry. Magnets are optional and help secure it further with the added benefit of a satisfying 'clip' sound when attached.

The geometry of the brush_holder is such that it clips and holds the brush in place through friction fit. As noted in the installation guide, do not try to force the brush in if it's the wrong size; it will break quite easily.

You will need the following:

- 1x brass brush (I got the TriangleLabs brass/copper brush and cut it down to length).
- 2x M3X8mm SHCS
- 2x 6x3mm round magnets (optional)

STLs are included here and CAD files as well if you wish to change the dimensions.

Below is an installation guide:
