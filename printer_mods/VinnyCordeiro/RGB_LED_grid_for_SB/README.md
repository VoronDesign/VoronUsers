# RGB LED grid for the Stealthburner (a.k.a. Rainbow Barf Logo LED)

![](IMG_2805.gif)

This PCB, created in KiCad 6.0, is a collaboration between me and [tanaes (a.k.a. whoppingpochard)](https://github.com/tanaes/whopping_Voron_mods/tree/main/LEDs/Rainbow_Barf_Logo_LED). It's a RBG 8√ó LED grid to be used on the logo of the Voron Stealthburner, to give the user more animation options than a single, boring RGB LED. üòÅ

Important note: this PCB uses 2.0mm √ó 2.0mm WS2812B RGB LEDs, instead of the recommended RGBW ones. In order to use the Rainbow Barf on the Stealthburner, you have to properly configure Klipper with a string of 8 RGB + 2 RGBW LEDs. [Klipper's documentation is your friend.](https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_Reference.html#neopixel)

WARNING: as far as June 21st, 2022, JLCPCB does not offer WS2812B-2020 LEDs for assembly anymore, which means anyone wanting to build the Rainbow Barf will either need to hand solder the 2 mm x 2 mm LEDs, or use another fab house for assembly service. This may change in the future, but for now it is the current situation.

### Updates

January 16th, 2022: Initial release.

February 18th, 2022: added link for whoppingpochard's Rainbow Barf's repository, and info about Klipper-led-effect developing a solution for mixing RGB and RGBW LEDs. There are little cosmetic differences between that version and the one I've uploaded here, nothing that will change the way it works. Choose whatever suits you better. üôÇ

March 17th, 2022: added the KiCad version that was used to design the PCB.

May 6th, 2022: sligthly modified the PCB by removing both the data in resistor and the filtering capacitor. They are not strictly necessary, and the presence of the resistor was making people needing an additional resistor on their controller board's data pin to match impedance. Removing the board's resistor should solve that. There are also some cosmetic changes, and I slightly increased the area available for the power planes.

June 8th, 2022: Added information about how to use the Rainbow Barf on Klipper using the main repo, and how to mix it with the nozzle RGBW LEDs.

June 21st, 2022: Added a warning concerning JLCPCB not providing the WS2812B-2020 LEDs anymore.
