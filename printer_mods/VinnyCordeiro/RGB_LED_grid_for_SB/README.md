# RGB LED grid for the Stealthburner (a.k.a. Rainbow Barf Logo LED)

![](IMG_2805.gif)

This PCB, created in KiCad 6.0, is a collaboration between me and [tanaes (a.k.a. whoppingpochard)](https://github.com/tanaes/whopping_Voron_mods/tree/main/LEDs/Rainbow_Barf_Logo_LED). It's a RBG 8√ó LED grid to be used on the logo of the Voron Stealthburner, to give the user more animation options than a single, boring RGB LED. üòÅ

Important note: this PCB uses 2.0mm √ó 2.0mm WS2812B RGB LEDs, they should not be used with RGBW LEDs in the same chain unless you know what are you doing, as they use different data protocols. The usage is possible, but it isn't straightforward. There is information that a workaround for mixing RGB and RGBW LEDs is being developed at the [Klipper-led_effect](https://github.com/julianschill/klipper-led_effect) repository, which is what whoppingpochard and I recommend for controlling this board.

### Updates

January 16th, 2022: Initial release.

February 18th, 2022: added link for whoppingpochard's Rainbow Barf's repository, and info about Klipper-led-effect developing a solution for mixing RGB and RGBW LEDs. There are little cosmetic differences between that version and the one I've uploaded here, nothing that will change the way it works. Choose whatever suits you better. üôÇ

March 17th, 2022: added the KiCad version that was used to design the PCB.
