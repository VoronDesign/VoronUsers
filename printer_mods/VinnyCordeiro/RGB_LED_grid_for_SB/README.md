# RGB LED grid for the Stealthburner

This PCB is a collaboration between me and [tanaes (a.k.a. whoppingpochard)](https://github.com/tanaes). It's a RBG 8√ó LED grid to be used on the logo of the Voron Stealthburner, to give the user more animation options than a single, boring RGB LED. üòÅ

Important note: this PCB uses 2.0mm √ó 2.0mm WS2812B RGB LEDs, they should not be used with RGBW LEDs in the same chain unless you know what are you doing, as they use different data protoocols. The usage is possible, but it isn't straightforward.
