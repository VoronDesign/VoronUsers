# Voron Afterburner Turbo Mod

This is a **purely cosmetic** mod for the Afterburner to bring it's appearance closer to Stealthburner.

After having seen Stealthburner, Afterburner's design started to look a little dated to me. So I designed this mod.
It simply replaces both of Afterburner's front parts with a single part. The only new hardware required are two shorter screws.
