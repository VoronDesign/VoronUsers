# LGX Lite plus Steathburner PCB cover
This is a modification of the door/cable cover that was created by HartK to go over the Stealthburner PCB he designed combined with the LGX_Lite_Steathburner mount created by Eytecz.

I have modified the door/cable cover from HartK so that there is room for the PCB when attached to an LGX Lite.

There is also a LGX PCB mount which I have created and has been uploaded as well to the VoronUsers repository.
