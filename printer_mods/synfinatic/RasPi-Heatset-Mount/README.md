# RasPi Mount with Heatset Inserts

This is basically the same as the stock Voron RasPi mount, but uses
M2.5 heatset inserts for the mounting.  Specifically useful for people
using PoE or relay hats on their RasPi as this makes assembly much easier
than screwing into plastic.

Note that these are M2.5 heatset inserts and not the "Voron standard" M3!
