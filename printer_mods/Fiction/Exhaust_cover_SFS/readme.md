# Voron V2.4 exhaust cover and BTT Smart Filament Sensor mount

The STLs will work with 3mm foam (compressed to 2.5mm) but other thicknesses are possible

## BTT Smart Filament Sensor wiring

The supplied cable works as-is with the Fysetc Spider V1.1; I'm using it on Y-MIN which is PB13. A longer cable might be required in which case a 4-pin JST PH 2.0 connector is needed for the sensor end, and a 3-pin JST XH connector for the control board end.
