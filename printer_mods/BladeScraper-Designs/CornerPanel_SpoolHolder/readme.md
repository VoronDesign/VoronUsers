## Purpose
I originally came up with this mod in order to accommodate my custom hinged rear panel.  The stock spoolholder gets in the way of the hinging panel and won't allow it to open without removing the spool holder.  This mod moves the spoolholder to the top rear corner panel clip, allowing for easier access to the rear panel as well as providing a more secure mount.  It requires minimal hardware and is very easy to install.

## Required Hardware
1 x M3 Nut (Square, Hex, or NoDropNut, any will work) <br>
2 x M3x10 BHCS

## Install Instructions
1. Remove stock spool holder.  You can reuse the PTFE lengths.
2. Remove left side panel.  
3. Remove top rear corner panel clip from the acrylic panel.  Hopefully you used VHB instead of glue :)
4. Remove rear left foot and install one extra M3 dropnut (or use NoDropNuts Mod) onto the left side of the rear left extrusion.
5. Install the modified CornerPanel onto the side panel.  
6. Install the spool holder using the M3x10 BHCS.   One of them will replace the original M3x8 in the old panel clip.
