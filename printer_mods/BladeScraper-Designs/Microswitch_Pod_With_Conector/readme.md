This is a simple modification to the microswitch pod to allow the installation of a JST-XH 4-pin connector.

JST-XH  4-pin connector part number B4B-XH-A(LF)(SN) slides into the hole and there's a small lip to keep it sliding all the way thru.  
Depending on your tolerances it may be tight enough as is, or you may have to use a bit of CA glue.  You may need to clean up the inside of the slot a bit using a utility knife to get the JST in, as it does involve bridging.

I also slightly increased the size of the screw holes from 1.5mm to 1.7mm as I was having a hard time getting mine screwed down.
