I loved the Ender 3 to Switchwire conversions that Gizzle and Triano did, but I didn't like the idea of losing z-height, so I created this mod.
These parts are to extend the usable z-height of the printer back up around 250mm (I get 247mm with it on my own printer).  I re-used the upper Z parts Gizzle designed, and am including those here as well so you have everything you need in this repository.
I am also include a bowden tube guide that will let you route your bowden tube between the belts and the upper cross member of the printer as seen in the picture here:
