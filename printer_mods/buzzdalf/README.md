Afterburner connector cover for the LDO 42STH20-1004AS stepper motor for Voron v1.8 and v2.4.

This is a modification of the mod hhammarstrand did for the Switchwire.  
That mod does not fit the AB correctly on a 1.8 or a 2.4, so I created a new mod that follows his design principles, but that fit oon a 1.8 and a 2.4

This mod has been verified to fit the LDO-42STH20-1004AS on both a Voron 1.8 and 2.4.
