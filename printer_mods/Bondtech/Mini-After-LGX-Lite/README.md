## AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE VORON ORIGINAL SETUP

### The Mini After-LGX-Lite

Designed by Olof Ogland, based on a draft design by Nemgrea.

This project also includes:

- Mounts for several hotends;
- AdaFruit and Generic ADXL345 accelerometer mounts – for Klipper’s input shaping tuning;
- Z-axis Bed Adjustable Y offset set – to allow the print bed to move back and forth from -1 up to +3.5 mm.
- Klicky – a z-probe mount that attaches with magnets
