# Spurs for Voron V2.4 #
This mod is intended to make access to the electronics compartment easier by enabling the printer to be tilted on its back without damaging cables or the exhaust system.
The spurs are mounted on the vertical extrusions in the back replacing the panel corners. Additionally they are braced against the horizontal back extrusion.
The mod is designed for and tested with a V2.4, but it might work with a V1 or Trident as well. Due to their higher center of gravity V1 and Trident might need additional feet higher up.

### Hardware needed: ###
| pcs. | name               |
|------|--------------------|
| 4    | M5x10 BHCS         |
| 4    | M3x12 SHCS         |
| 2    | M3x20 SHCS         |
| 4    | M5 T-nut           |
| 4    | M3 T-nut           |
| 2    | M3 Threaded Insert |

As all these are in the BOM of a V2.4 it is highly likely you can build this mod with leftovers from your printer.

### Printing: ###
#### Print Settings: ####
This mod needs structural integrity and high stiffness. Based on the Voron recommendations for structural printer parts these settings are recommended:
- 0.4mm Nozzle
- 5 Perimeters
- 40% Infill
- 10 top and bottom Layers
The test print in the pictures is done with Formfutura rTitan ABS.

#### Support: ####
All the STLs are oriented correctly. The spurs themselves have overhangs where the backpanel is supposed to sit. Make sure to support them properly, especially the corner and under the M5 Screw holes, where the material gets thin to avoid voids as experienced in the test prints:

All parts should fit comfortably on any V2.4 buildplate.

Melt M3 threaded inserts into the braces.

### Assembly: ###
Start with assembling the two corner modules. Insert the braces into the spurs and screw them together using the M3x20 SHCS crews.
Remove the bottom corner panel clips and insert the T-nuts. Two M5 T-nuts into each vertical extrusion and two M3 T-nuts on each side of the horizontal extrusion.
Put the corner modules in place and screw them in place by using two M5x10 BHCS and two M3x12 SHCS each.

__Optional:__ To increase the stiffness even further you can replace the base plate of the feet with the one of this mod. Its fork pieces fit right into the spurs supporting them during tilting.
