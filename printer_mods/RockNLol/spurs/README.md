# Spurs for Voron V2.4 and Trident #
This mod is intended to make access to the electronics compartment easier by enabling the printer to be tilted on its back without damaging cables or the exhaust system.
The spurs are mounted on the vertical extrusions in the back replacing the panel corners. Additionally they are braced against the horizontal back extrusion.

### Hardware needed: ###
| pcs. | name               |
|------|--------------------|
| 4    | M5x10 BHCS         |
| 4    | M3x10 SHCS         |
| 2    | M3x20 SHCS         |
| 4    | M5 T-nut           |
| 4    | M3 T-nut           |
| 2    | M3 Threaded Insert |

As all these are in the BOM of a V2.4 or Trident it is higly likely you can do this with leftovers from your printer build.
