# <B>Flexi Feet for Voron 1.x/2.x</B>

A very simple foot meant to be printed out of a flexible filament to replace the stock rubber compressor feet on the Voron BOM.

There are a few improvements over the stock compressor foot, namely:

1. Lower profile means you can open the electronics compartment hatch without getting the door caught on the feet.
2. Foot profile is 100% under the printer so the feet don't bend over if you turn the printer on it's side as happens with the stock feet.
3. Easier access to the m3 bolts attaching the Z drive base plate plate to the chassis. 
4. Customizable rigidity of the foot by adjusting infill/perimeters.
5. Customizable colors. :)

### <B>Printed Parts</B>

These can be found in the STL subdirectory.

- 4x flexi-foot.stl

I printed the parts with 2 perimeters, and 15% infill, but this is adjustable of course, dependent on how rigid you want the feet.

## <B>Assembly Instructions</B>

1. Remove all 4 Z drive base plates by unscrewing the 3x M3x8 screws (careful not to lose the M5 nut on the reverse side)
2. Swap stock compressor foot with FlexiFoot.
3. Re-install all 4 z drive base plates.
