Mount Z-Axis zipchain under the rear gantry crossbar, instead of in front of it.  Cleaner look,
and frees up some room back there.  Print 2 of each STL.  One anchor attaches to a standoff for
the bottom.  The second standoff is use as a spacer to support the chain when gantry is in lower
positions.  Additional zipchain links will also be needed.
