# Voron 2.4 Misumi Shoulder Bolts
Modified parts to use Misumi shoulder bolts (Shoulder Bolts - Tolerance e9 (MISUMI)) and optionally a single MGN12H rail. It should also work with dual MGN9H rails.

The Misumi shoulder bolts are 5mm shoulder and a 3mm thread. These parts use the standard M3 4mm length threaded insert used everywhere else in the V2.4. You do not need to torque these down, just tighten them so they are flush. A little thread locker on just the threads (and only the threads) wouldn't hurt anything, but is not needed.

Note: Quantity is the newly added amounts and should be added to whatever quantity (threaded inserts) that is already used.

## XY Tensioners:
Item | Qty
-- | --
MSB5-35        | x2
M3x5x4 Insert  | x2

## XY Joints:
Item | Qty
-- | --
MSB5-40        | x4
M3x5x4 Insert  | x4

## Motor Plates:
Item | Qty
-- | --
MSB5-LC21.5-FC5 | x4
M3x5x4 Insert   | x4

## Z Idlers:
There are 2 variations of these. One uses the M3x5x4 standard length inserts, and the other uses the M3x5x6 length inserts. The 6mm variant would have the bolt heads sit flush on the outside, while the standard 4mm would have the bolts inset a little. I expect no "perfomance" benefit to either.

Item | Qty
-- | --
MSB5-20         | x4
MSB5-LC21.5-FC5 | x4 (optional)
M3x5x4 Insert   | x4
M3x5x6 Insert   | x4 (optional)

If you want to spend the extra money, print the 6mm stls, use 4mm length inserts and get/use 4 more of the MSB5-LC21.5-FC5 bolts. These bolts will sit flush on both sides and they'll have a little more depth engagement on the thread side of the idler.

**Note:** In the US, at the time I ordered, the pricing for these should bolts dropped signifcantly with a quantity discount. For example, MSB5-40 were quoted at $3.40 each and $14.96 for 4. But, quantity 10 dropped the price each down to $1.40, so you could get 10 of them for $14.00; cheaper than you can get 4.  Everyone has a friend that's building a Voron right? Right?
