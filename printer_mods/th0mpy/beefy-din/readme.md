# BEEFY Din

I made these Din clips to replace the Voron "print in place" clips. I had issues, no matter the print settings and/or material, with the items staying in place. These clips are two parts, the main clip and moving shuttle. The only additional piece is the spring. I used yellow and blue bed springs and it clips everything very tight, but still able to remove.

I would not recommend that you use brown/red or other heavier bed springs since it applies too much pressure. 

## Printing

Standard Voron print settings should work well, 0.4mm nozzle with 0.2mm layer height. PETG or ABS recommended. 

## What to print
You will need to print two pieces for one clip.

| Filename |  Use |

## Assembly

Assemble before installation. Insert spring into shuttle and slide into the groves in the underside of the main body. The holes may need to be drilled out a little to fit.
