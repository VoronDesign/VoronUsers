Voron Parts Logo for your VORON Printer

STL File - You can print this logo on your 3D printer. I have included base (1mm thick) in this stl file which you can print in base color (at 0.2mm layer height) 
           & change filament after 5 layers to your accent color

Image Files - Image files are included in high quality JPG & PNG format if anyone wants to print them on paper with traditional ink printer.

DXF File - DXF file is included if anyone wants to cut this on laser cutter out of Vinyl wrap. (Like I did, Shown in Images below)
