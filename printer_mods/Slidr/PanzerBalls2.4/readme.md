What are Panzerballs?
- Panzerballs are another type of feet using commonly available squash balls.

Why do they exist?
- i hate sourcing of rubber compressor feet
- i felt that other squash ball mods do not satisfy me visually (sry)

Why do i need Panzerballs?
- You probably don´t need them unless you got problems with sourcing the normal rubber compressor feet 
or you want something more squishy with maybe a better noise reduction.

How do i install Panzerballs?
- Panzerballs are a drop in replacement for the base plate
- You need:
  - 4x squash balls (super slow, double yellow dot, diameter 39.5-40.5 mm)
