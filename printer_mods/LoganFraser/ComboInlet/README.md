These skirt plates are for the fuse-filter-switch combo c14 inlets.  

The wide one is for the larger switch in Shaffner FN283-10-06 inlets
or other equivalent product from a reputable reseller. Amazon/Aliexpress not recommended.

The narrow one is for the smaller switch in the style of adamstech inlets.  I don't have an example part number.  

BOM - Same as stock part, plus:
2 - M3 5x4mm heatsets (voron standard) 
2 - M3-8mm flat head screws (or longer)
