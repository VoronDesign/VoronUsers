Very rough and ready:

- Put some foam on the plate edges
- Push the bowden tube through, it's a tight fit you may need to ream the hole
- Add some standard heat set inserts
- Take out the one strut of the exhaust grill that interfers with bowden
- Screw to frame, clamp to back panel with exhaust grill from the inside

Ignore the missing nuts it's because the led bar interferes.
