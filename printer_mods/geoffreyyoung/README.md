* [`spider_bracket.stl`](https://github.com/geoffrey-young/VoronUsers/tree/geoffrey-young-spider_bracket/printer_mods/geoffreyyoung/spider_bracket) - Minimalist DIN bracket for the [FYSETC SPIDER](https://wiki.fysetc.com/Spider/), based on the simple design of the core SKR bracket.  It uses a [standard build `pcb_din_clip_x3.stl`](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/blob/Voron2.4/STLs/VORON2.4/Electronics_Compartment/DIN_Brackets/pcb_din_clip_x3.stl), and provides integrated horizontal and vertical mount options so you can choose on the fly.
