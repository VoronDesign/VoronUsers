* [Dual Rail Installation Guide](./dual_rail_guide) - Guide for centering the Voron 2.4 dual X rails during installation.
* [FYSETC SPIDER DIN Bracket](./spider_bracket) - Minimalist DIN bracket for the [FYSETC SPIDER](https://wiki.fysetc.com/Spider/), based on the simple design of the core SKR bracket.  It uses a [standard build `pcb_din_clip_x3.stl`](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/blob/Voron2.4/STLs/VORON2.4/Electronics_Compartment/DIN_Brackets/pcb_din_clip_x3.stl), and provides integrated horizontal and vertical mount options so you can choose on the fly.
