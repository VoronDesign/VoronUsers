# MarcPot Skirt Mods
Pictures coming soon. Already printed and tested, just forgot to take pictures.

**WARNING I HAVE NOT TESTED THE 250 and 350 VERSIONS. PLEASE TELL ME IF YOU DID AND I'LL EDIT THIS WARNING.
I have checked them all in my slicer and they sliced correctly.
## Overview
These are my mods for the Voron V2.4 Skirts. They are modifications of [the official Voron V2.4 skirts](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2\STLs\VORON2.4\Skirts).

## BOM
* M3x8 SHCS.
* Keystone inserts.

**OR

* [Hour Counter](https://aliexpress.com/item/33010541388.html?)

## Printing instructions
No special printing instructions. They are skirts.

## Assembly instructions
No special Assembly instructions. They are skirts.

## CAD
I uploaded the original 300 cad files I created because I did some really ugly things to get to the 250 and 350. So you're probably better of starting at the 300 if you want to edit them yourself. I did save them ofcourse so contact me if you want the files.

## Questions

## Images
