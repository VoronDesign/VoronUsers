# UHP PSU Bracket
![All Options](Images/all_tests.JPEG)

## Overview
This is a DIN 3 Rail (35mm W) bracket for the Mean Well UHP series powersupply edited from [the official Voron Mean Well LRS series powersupply bracket](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/blob/Voron2.4/STLs/VORON2.4/Electronics_Compartment/DIN_Brackets/lrs_psu_bracket_clip.stl). This design has 2 versions, one with an embedded nut and one with an heat-set insert.

## BOM
* 4x M3x6 BHCS.
* 4x M3 Hexnut. **OR** 4x M3 Heat set inserts (M3x5x4).

## Printing instructions
No special printing instructions. Part doesn't have to carry much weight.

## Assembly instructions
Personally I added a little glue to the embedded nut to make it stick, but this is not needed.
