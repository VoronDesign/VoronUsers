# V0 Bed Wagos

Attach Wago 221-412 to your v0 bed.

I wanted a way to bridge the bed fuse, without using a semi-permanent connector.

Easy to install. Just pop [Front_Bed_Mount_x1.STL](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0/blob/master/VORON-0/STLs/Front_Bed_Mount_x1.STL) off the front of your bed, slide in some nuts, slip on the wago mount and you're all done.

Prints fine, I'm sure the design could be improved upon. Especially, the 2x. I got lazy there.
